<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER I.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>JERRY, HARRY, AND BLUMPO.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll race you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Done! Are you ready?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then off we go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quicker than it can be related, four oars fell into
the water and four sturdy arms bent to the task
of sending two beautiful single-shell craft skimming
over the smooth surface of the lake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a spirited scene, and attracted not a
little attention, for both of the contestants were
well known.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go it, Jerry! You can beat him if you try!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t let him get ahead, Harry. Keep closer
to the shore!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How far is the race to be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Up to the big pine tree and back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a full mile and more. I’ll bet on Jerry
Upton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span>
“And I’ll bet on Harry Parker. He has more
skill than Jerry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Jerry has the muscle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There they go, side by side!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And thus the talking and shouting went on
along the lake front. Most of the boys present
were members of the Lakeview Boat Club, but
there were others of the town there, too, as enthusiastic
as the rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a clear, warm day in June. The summer
holidays at the various institutes of learning in
the vicinity had just begun, so many of the lads
had nothing to do but to enjoy themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were not a few craft out besides the two
shells to which we have drawn attention. But
they drew out of the way to give the racers a free
field.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On and on went Jerry and Harry until the big
pine was reached. Then came the turn, and they
started on the home stretch side by side, neither
one foot ahead of the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s going to be a tie race.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pull, Harry! Let yourself out!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Show him what you can do, Jerry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Encouraged by the shouts of their friends, both
boys increase their speed. But the increase on
both sides was equal, and still the boats kept
bow and bow as they neared the boathouse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s going to be a tie, sure enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span>
“Spurt a bit, Jerry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go it for all you’re worth, Harry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the two contestants put forth additional
muscle, each to out-distance his opponent, and
again the two row-boats leaped forward, still side
by side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As old Jack Broxton, the keeper of the boathouse,
said afterward: “It would have taken
twelve judges, sitting twelve days, to have told
which had the advantage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The finishing point was now less than five hundred
feet distant, and in a few seconds more the
race would be over. The crowd began to stop
shouting, almost breathless with pent-up interest.
It was surely the prettiest race that had ever been
rowed on Otasco Lake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Splash!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The splash was followed by a splutter, and then
a frantic cry for help. A portion of the high float
in front of the boathouse had unexpectedly given
way, and a short, stocky, reddish-black youth
had gone floundering over board.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blumpo Brown has gone under.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It serves him right for standing away out on
the edge of the float.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Help! Help!” cried the youth in the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold on, Harry! Jerry, don’t run into me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alarmed by the cries, the two racers turned
around, easing up on their oars as they did so.
<span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span>
A single glance showed them that the unfortunate
one was directly in their path.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must stop!” cried Jerry Upton to his
friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right; call it off,” responded Harry
Parker. “It was a tie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he finished, both shells drew up, one on either
side of Blumpo Brown. Each of the rowers
offered the struggling youth a helping hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blumpo was soon clinging to Jerry’s shell. He
was dripping from head to foot, and not being at
all a handsomely-formed or good-looking youth,
he presented a most comical appearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s too bad I spoiled the race,” mumbled
Blumpo. “But that’s just me—always putting
my foot into it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess you put more than your foot into it
this time,” was Harry’s good-natured comment,
as he ran close up alongside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where shall I land you, Blumpo?” questioned
Jerry Upton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anywhere but near the boathouse,” returned
Blumpo, with a shiver that was not brought on
entirely by his involuntary bath. “If you land
me there the fellows won’t give me a chance to get
out of sight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take you up the lake shore if you wish,”
said Jerry. “I intended to go up anyway in a
row-boat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span>
“All right, Jerry, do that and I’ll be much
obliged to you,” returned Blumpo Brown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are going along, aren’t you, Harry?” continued
Jerry, turning to his late rival.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I want to stop at Mrs. Fleming’s cottage,”
replied Harry Parker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a moment more Harry had turned his shell
over to old Jack Broxton and had leaped into a
row-boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ain’t you fellows going to try it over again?”
asked several on the shore, anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not now,” returned Jerry. Then he went on
to Harry, in a lower tone: “I didn’t expect to
make a public exhibition of our little trial at
speed, did you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; not at all. It was a tie, and let it remain
so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry soon left his shell; and then four oars soon
took the row-boat far away from the vicinity of
the shore; and while the three boys are on their
way up the lake, let us learn a little more concerning
them, especially as they are to form the all-important
characters of this tale of midsummer
adventures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry Upton was the only son of a well-to-do farmer,
whose farm of one hundred acres lay just beyond
the outskirts of Lakeview, and close to the
lake shore. Jerry was a scholar at the Lakeview
Academy, and did but little on the farm, although
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>
among the pupils he was often designated as Cornfield.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry Parker was the oldest boy in the Parker
family, which numbered two boys and four girls.
Harry’s father was a shoe manufacturer, whose
large factory was situated in Lakeview, and at
which nearly a fourth of the working population
of the town found employment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had been a singular incident which had
brought the two boys together and made them
firm friends. Both had been out skating on the
lake the winter before, when Harry had lost his
skate and gone down headlong directly in the
track of a large ice-boat, which was coming on
with the speed of a breeze that was almost a hurricane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the onlookers it seemed certain that Harry
must be struck and killed by the sharp prow of
the somewhat clumsy craft. But in that time of
extreme peril Jerry had whipped up like a flash on
his skates, caught Harry by the collar, and literally
flung himself and the boy, who was then almost
a stranger to him, out of harm’s way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This gallant deed of courage had been warmly
applauded by those who saw it. It also came to
Mr. Parker’s ears, and from that time on the rich
shoe manufacturer took an interest in the farmer
boy. He persuaded Mr. Upton to allow Jerry to
attend the academy, and promised that the boy
<span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span>
should have a good position in the office of the
factory, should he wish it, when his school days
were over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry was already a pupil at the academy, and
it was here that the two boys became warm
friends. It was nothing to Harry that Jerry was
a farmer’s boy and that he was sometimes called
Cornfield. He knew and appreciated Jerry for his
true worth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now what of Blumpo Brown, you ask?
There is little to tell at this point of our story
concerning that semi-colored individual. He was
alone in the world, and had lived in Lakeview
some ten years. Previous to that time his history
was a mystery. Where he had come from no one
knew, and if the truth was to be made known, no
one but Blumpo himself cared. He was a very
peculiar youth, often given to making the most
ridiculous remarks, and many persons around
Lakeview fancied he had considerable Indian
blood in him. He lived in half a dozen places,
according to the condition of his finances, and
picked up his precarious existence by working for
anyone who would employ him. He might have
had a steady situation more than once, but it was
not in Blumpo’s composition to stick at one thing
for any great length of time. We will learn much
more concerning him as our story proceeds.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>MRS. FLEMING’S RUNAWAY HORSE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, now that the midsummer holidays have
really commenced, what do you intend to do with
yourself, Jerry?” asked Harry, as they took it
easy for a bit after leaving the vicinity of the
town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect I’ll have to help on the farm—at least,
I think I ought to help,” was the reply. “You
know this is the busy season.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry’s face fell a little at this reply. Evidently
something was on his mind, and this answer did
not harmonize with it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell you what I would like mighty well,”
put in Blumpo. “I would like to leave town and
take to the woods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Blumpo, you must have been reading my
thoughts!” cried Harry. “I was thinking exactly
the same thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take to the woods?” repeated Jerry. “What
do you mean? Clear out from home entirely?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no,” laughed Harry. “I mean to go off
for awhile—say, two or three weeks or a month.
Sail up the lake and camp out, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span>
“Oh!” Jerry’s face took on a pleased look. “I
would like that myself, especially if we could go
fishing and swimming whenever we wanted to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve had it in my mind for several days,” Harry
continued, slowly. “I was going to speak of
it yesterday, but I didn’t get the chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean you want me to go with you?” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Don’t you think your folks would let
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They might. Who else would go along, do
you think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t thought of anyone else. We might
ask—” and Harry hesitated in thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter with asking me?” put in
Blumpo, with a serenity that took away the lack
of politeness in his remark. “I’m just as tired of
Lakeview as anybody.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry burst out laughing. The idea of asking
Blumpo had never once entered his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It ain’t nothing to laugh at,” went on Blumpo,
half angrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excuse me, Blumpo,” said Harry, stopping
short. “I—that is—I wasn’t thinking of you
when I made the remark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not rich, nor eddicated, as you call it, and
all that, but I can hunt and fish, and so on, as
good as the next feller, can’t I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You certainly can,” put in Jerry, who had for
<span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>
a long time had a strange liking for the homeless
youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I am as willing as the next one to do my
full share of camp work—washing dishes and the
like,” went on Blumpo. “You ain’t cut out for
that,” he added, turning to the son of the rich
shoe manufacturer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe not, but I reckon I can do my full share
of work,” laughed Harry. “I was not brought up
with kid gloves on, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One thing is certain,” mused Jerry. “I
wouldn’t want to leave until I had rowed that
race with Si Peters from Rockpoint.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The race to which Jerry referred was one to take
place on the following Saturday. Silas Peters was
considered the best single-shell oarsman on the
lower side of the lake, and he had challenged Jerry
as a representative from the Lakeview Academy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll win that race, suah,” put in Blumpo.
“I’ll bet my hat on it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Blumpo’s hat was of straw and full of holes,
this made both Jerry and his friend burst into a
fit of laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t mean this hat. I mean my Sunday-go-to-meetin’
one,” said the homeless youth, hastily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blumpo, on your honor, did you ever own two
hats at once?” asked Harry gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, since you buckle me down, no,” was the
low reply. “What’s the use? Can’t wear but one
at a time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>
“That’s as true as you live,” returned Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three boys talked over the subject of an
outing for some time. All thought it a glorious
idea, and Jerry said he would go if he possibly
could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this time Jerry and Harry were rowing up
the lake at a moderate rate of speed. Jerry loved
the water, and spent nearly all of his spare time
in the vicinity of the lake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently Harry grew tired and Blumpo took
his place at the oars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here comes the Cutwater!” cried Harry, a few
minutes later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Cutwater was a large sloop owned by one of
the gentlemen living in Lakeview. As she came
past, those in the row-boat noticed several young
ladies on board, who were sailing the boat under
directions of a young man named Clarence Conant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clarence had but little idea how a boat should
be managed, and as the sloop went by Harry’s
face grew troubled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jerry, what do you think of that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry stopped rowing for a moment to look at
the sloop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A good lot of sail up, especially if it should
blow up stronger,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just what I think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That Clarence Conant don’t know nuffin’
about sailing,” snorted Blumpo Brown. “The
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>
ladies better beware how they go out with
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I agree with you, Blumpo,” said Jerry, gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sloop now disappeared from sight around a
turn in the lake at which several islands were
situated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few minutes later the row-boat drew up to a
small dock at the end of a well-kept garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was Mrs. Fleming’s place, where Harry
intended to stop on an errand for his mother and
father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sprang on the dock and hurried toward the
house, saying he would not be gone more than
five minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two boys waited for him to return, and
during the interval Jerry caught sight of the Cutwater
up the lake and watched her progress with
interest. The wind was getting stronger and the
sloop carried more sail than was good for her.
Soon she again disappeared, and Jerry turned toward
the house, wondering what kept Harry so
long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Must have been invited to lunch,” was Blumpo’s
comment. “Pity he didn’t ask us in, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, he wouldn’t stay and leave us here,” replied
Jerry, “Most likely—hullo!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry sprang up in the row-boat in amazement.
Down the garden path leading from the front of
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>
the house to the dock came a beautiful black
horse on a gallop. On the animal’s back sat a
little girl not more than eight years of age. The
horse was running away with her, and she was
clinging tightly to his mane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, John, stop him!” she screamed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whoa, Banker, whoa!” shouted a man who
came running after the animal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the horse, a nervous creature, was frightened
over something and would not stop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He clattered on the dock, and the next instant
went over into the lake with a loud splash, carrying
the little girl with him.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER III.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>JERRY’S BRAVERY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Blumpo was so scared by the accident that he
uttered a short yell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fo’ the lan’ sake,” he moaned, in a shaking
voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The horse disappeared from sight for a brief
space of time and then came up and began to
churn the water madly in an endeavor to save
himself from drowning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little girl was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’ll be drowned,” thought Jerry, with rising
horror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that moment a lady rushed from the house,
followed by Harry. It was Mrs. Fleming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My child! my child!” she shrieked. “Save my
Cora!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry waited to hear no more. At that moment
the head of the little girl appeared directly by the
horse’s side, and he made a clever dive from the
row-boat and came up close to the child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl was so bewildered that she simply beat
the water in a helpless fashion, and this frightened
the horse still more.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>
Swimming up behind the little one, Jerry caught
her under the arms. It was a perilous thing to do,
for Jerry was in great danger of having his brains
dashed out by one of the horse’s hoofs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good for you, Jerry!” shouted Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look out for the hoss!” shouted the man.
“He’ll kick you if he can!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As rapidly as he could, Jerry swam out of the
mad animal’s reach. It was difficult with the
struggling girl in his arms, but at last he accomplished
it, and willing hands helped him to the
dock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Cora! my Cora! is she dead?” cried Mrs.
Fleming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, she is more frightened than hurt,” returned
Jerry. “Let us take her to the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But before he could go a step, Mrs. Fleming
clasped her girl in her arms and led the way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anxious to be of assistance, Jerry followed the
lady, while Harry, Blumpo, and the hired man
tried to rescue the horse, who was very valuable
despite his nervousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A noose was made at the end of a rope, and
this was thrown over the animal’s neck. Then
the horse got one foot through the noose, and in
this fashion they towed him to a spot where it
was easy for him to wade out without assistance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hired man was very much put out, for it
was his fault that the horse had run away. He
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>
led the animal around to the barn and gave him
a good rubbing down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry started for the house and met Jerry coming
out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is Cora?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s all right. Come on,” and Jerry brushed
on toward the row-boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, what’s your hurry, Jerry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young oarsman blushed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I hate to stand around and receive
thanks,” he said. “Mrs. Fleming wants to make
a first-class hero of me and I——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that’s just what you are,” cried Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed he is,” added Blumpo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense!” Jerry brushed them to one side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on!” and he made a run for the row-boat,
and the others were compelled to follow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But your clothing is all wet,” insisted Harry,
when they were seated in the craft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So is Blumpo’s,” returned Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’se most dry, the sun is that warm,” remarked
the homeless youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t mind the wetting a bit,” said Jerry.
“Rowing will keep me warm and the sun will dry
me off quick enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a regular water dog, anyway,” laughed
Harry. He could not help but admire Jerry’s
modesty in running away from Mrs. Fleming as
soon as it was ascertained that little Cora was all
right.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>
On and on up the lake the boys went. Inside of
half an hour they came to a sheltered nook on one
of the numerous islands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I move we take a swim,” said Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Second de emotion,” said Blumpo, and before
Jerry could say a word the homeless youth was
running about as if in the savage wilds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It did not take Jerry and Harry long to disrobe.
The plunge into the water was very pleasant, and
they remained in bathing until Jerry’s clothing,
spread out on the top of a number of bushes, was
thoroughly dry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meanwhile Jerry and Harry raced to
another island and back. Jerry came out first,
with Harry four yards behind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The swim over, they dressed, and, after picking
several handfuls of berries, which grew on the
island in profusion, they once more embarked in
the row-boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Time to get back, boys,” said Jerry. “I
promised to be home before dark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So did I,” said Harry, “and we have several
miles to go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It don’t make no difference to me when I git
back,” remarked Blumpo, dolefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t worry, Blumpo. Think of the good time
we are going to have when we go camping,” said
Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I must ask father for a regular situation
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>
for you when we come back from our outing,”
added Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you?” and the homeless boy’s face
brightened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wind had been increasing steadily, and now
it blew so strongly that the whitecaps were to be
seen in every direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re going to have no easy time getting
back,” said Jerry, with an anxious look on his
manly face. “Maybe we may be caught in a hurricane.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s hot enough,” returned Harry. “Such oppressive
heat generally means something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A mile was covered, and then the wind began to
send the flying spray in every direction and filled
the row-boat’s bottom with water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wet again!” laughed Jerry, grimly. “Never
mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blumpo, you had better bail out the boat,”
said Harry. He was as wet as the rest, but did
not grumble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the homeless youth bailed out the water
with a dipper they had brought along, Jerry and
Harry pulled at the oars with all their remaining
strength. Another mile was passed. But now it
was blowing a regular hurricane and no mistake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll go to the bottom, suah!” groaned
Blumpo dismally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much!” shouted Jerry. “Keep on bailing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>
“Look! look!” yelled Harry at that moment,
and pointed over to the centre of the lake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There, beating up in the teeth of the wind in the
most hap-hazard manner, was the Cutwater. Evidently
Clarence Conant was nearly paralyzed with
fear, for he had almost lost control of the craft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those ladies on board are worse off than we,”
went on Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s so,” replied Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the words were hardly out of his mouth
when there came an extra puff of wind. It sent
the Cutwater almost over on her side, and threw a
monstrous wave into the row-boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The smaller craft could not stand the wind and
waves, and with a lurch, she sank down and went
over, dumping all three of the youths into the
angry lake.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>SAVING THE SLOOP.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>It was no pleasant position to be in. The three
lads had been cast so suddenly into the angry
waters that for the moment they could not comprehend
the situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Blumpo let out a yell of terror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Save me! De boat has gone down!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was wrong, however, for a second later the
row-boat bobbed up, less than four yards off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This way!” shouted Harry to his companions,
but the wind fairly drowned his voice. He swam
toward the upturned craft, and Blumpo and Jerry
were not slow in following it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardly had they reached it when a new peril confronted
them. The Cutwater was bearing directly
down upon them. With every sail set, she was in
the very act of cutting them to pieces!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look! look!” yelled Harry. “We are
doomed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My gracious!” moaned Blumpo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On and on came the sloop, with gigantic bounds
over the whitecaps. Clarence Conant seemed utterly
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>
powerless to stay her course, or steer her to
the right or left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young ladies on board with him huddled in
a heap near the tiny cabin, their faces white with
terror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was truly a thrilling moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the entire crowd Jerry was the only one to
keep perfectly cool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was astride the row-boat, directly in the
centre of the bottom, and it seemed as if the prow
of the Cutwater must strike him in a second more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every one dive under!” he called out, and went
overboard like a flash.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a wonder Harry and Blumpo promptly followed
suit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Crash!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The row-boat was struck and stove in completely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Cutwater was quite a good-sized craft, and
though the force of the collision did not damage
her to any extent, it checked her progress considerably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry went down and down. He made a long
dive, and when he came up it was within a yard
of the sloop’s rudder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before another boy would have had time to
think, the boy who so loved the water made up
his mind what to do. He made a mighty leap
and caught hold of the rudder end ere the Cutwater
could get beyond his reach.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>
It was hard work to hang on, as the sloop bobbed
up and down with every wave, and the rudder,
being beyond control, swayed from side to side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Jerry was both plucky and full of grit. He
clung fast, and, watching his chance, climbed up
to the stern and leaped on the deck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A brief glance showed him the cause of the
present trouble. Clarence Conant was actually
too much frightened to lower the sails. He had
started to act and got a rope twisted, and then,
overcome with fear, had allowed the matter to go
while he clung to the bow in despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You confounded coward!” cried the young
oarsman. “You ought to have known better
than to go out on anything bigger than a duck
pond.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sprang to the halyards, and soon the main-sail
came down with a bang. The jib followed.
There was no time to attend to the sails more
than this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry looked around anxiously for Harry and
Blumpo, but for a long while could see nothing of
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here,” demanded Clarence Conant, recovering
his composure, now the greatest of the
danger was over. “What—ah—do you mean by
talking to me in this fashion?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean just what I say,” retorted Jerry.
“You had no right to take these young ladies out
and expose them to such peril.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>
“The—ah—hurricane took me by surprise,” was
the dude’s lame excuse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am very thankful to you, Jerry Upton,”
cried Dora Vincent, the oldest and prettiest of the
girls on board.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so am I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” replied the boy, blushing. “But
now is no time to talk. Which of you will take
the tiller, if I tell you exactly what to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can—ah—take the tiller,” interposed Conant,
haughtily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t touch it!” cried the young oarsman,
sternly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, boy, what do you mean? Do you—ah—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down! If you dare to stir I’ll pitch you
overboard!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Overcome with a new terror, the dude collapsed.
He was hatless, the curl was out of his mustache
and hair, and altogether he looked very much
“washed out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sank down near the bow, and it was well
that he did so, for just then came an extra heavy
blast of the gale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold hard, every one!” yelled Jerry. “Perhaps
you ladies had better go into the cabin,” he
added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am to take the tiller, you know,” said Dora
Vincent.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>
“Well, then, let the others go. We can work
along better with a clear deck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So while Dora went aft, the others crawled into
the cabin, or cuddy. Under pretense of seeing
after their comfort, Conant crawled after them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I will tell you just how to move the tiller,”
said Jerry to Dora Vincent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, I am ready,” responded the brave
girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now that she had Jerry with her, and knowing
he was well acquainted with boats, she felt that
she was safe, no matter how bad the storm might
prove itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After giving the girl some instructions Jerry
hoisted the main-sail a few feet only. The sloop
then swung around and moved in a beating way
against the storm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry wished to learn what had become of his
companions. He was fearful that they had been
drowned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It took quite some time to reach the vicinity
where the accident had occurred, and even then
but little was to be seen through the driving rain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo, Harry! Blumpo!” he called out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No answer came back and he repeated the cry a
dozen times. Then he fancied he heard a response
directly ahead. The sloop was moved cautiously
in the direction, and presently they saw Blumpo
clinging to part of the shattered row-boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>
“Sabe me! sabe me!” yelled the youth. “Don’t
let me drown, Jerry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Catch the rope, Blumpo!” cried Jerry in return,
and threw forward the end of a coil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blumpo clutched the rope eagerly, and then it
was comparatively easy to haul him on board.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Praise de Lawd!” he muttered fervently as he
came on deck. “I t’ought I was a goner, suah!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is Harry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t tell you, Jerry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You haven’t seen him since we jumped from
the row-boat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young oarsman’s face grew sober. What
if their chum had really gone to the bottom of
Lake Otasco? It would be awful to tell Harry’s
parents that their son was no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must find him, dead or alive, Blumpo.
Take the tiller from Miss Vincent, and we’ll cruise
around, with our eyes and ears wide open,” said
Jerry, with determination.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>HARRY IS RESCUED.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“I can stay on deck, can’t I?” asked Dora, as
she turned the tiller over to the homeless youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you wish. But be very careful when the
sloop swings around,” replied Jerry. “You did
very well,” he added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dora smiled at this. Then she went forward
and settled down, in spite of the rain, to help look
for Harry Parker, whose folks she knew fairly
well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Cutwater was put on a different track, and
they began to move across the lake, it being
Jerry’s idea to cross and recross at a distance of
every six or seven hundred feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Twice did they come close to each shore without
seeing anything of Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gone down, suah’s you’re born!” said Blumpo,
and the tears started out of his big, honest eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid so,” returned Jerry, “and yet—hark!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put up his hand and all were instantly on
the alert. The wind had gone down somewhat,
and from a distance came a low cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>
“It’s Harry’s!” said Jerry. “Hullo, Harry!”
he yelled, with all the power of his lungs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He waited, and an answering cry came back
from toward the center of the lake. It was very
weak, showing that Harry was almost exhausted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The course of the sloop was instantly changed,
and they strove to reach the spot before the boy
should go down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry was the first to see the form floating
about amid the whitecaps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep up, Harry!” he called encouragingly.
“We will soon have you on board.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t keep up any longer,” gasped his chum.
“I am played out.” And throwing up his arms,
Harry disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tying the end of a long rope about his waist,
Jerry leaped overboard. He struck the spot where
Harry had gone down and felt in every direction
for his chum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His hand touched an arm, and then he held
Harry fast and brought him to the surface. The
poor boy was too weak to make the first movement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haul in on the rope, Blumpo!” called Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turning the tiller over to Dora Vincent, the
homeless youth did as directed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry, with his burden, was soon brought alongside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was no easy matter to hoist Harry on deck in
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>
the storm, but at last it was accomplished, and
Jerry followed his charge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry was unconscious, and he was taken to the
cabin, where Dora and the other girls did all in
their power for him; and then the Cutwater was
headed for Lakeview, two miles distant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hurricane, or whatever it might be called,
had by this time spent itself. The rain ceased and
before the lake town came into view the sun shone
once more as brightly as ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clarence Conant came on deck looking very much
annoyed. He felt that he had played the part of a
coward, and knew he would have no easy time of
it to right himself in the eyes of the young ladies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The—ah—truth is, I was very sick,” he explained
to Jerry. “I got a—ah—spasm of the—ah—heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure it wasn’t a spasm in your great toe?”
said Jerry, with a grin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Clarence never smiled. It would not have
been good form, you know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as the dock was reached, Jerry left
Blumpo to tie up and went to Harry. He found
his chum able to sit up. He was very weak, but
that was all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a close call for me, Jerry,” said Harry,
with a shudder. “I owe you my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a close call all around,” replied our
hero. “We can be thankful that we are here safe
and sound.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>
Harry felt too weak to walk, so a carriage was
called to take him home. Jerry went with him,
while Blumpo went over to the grocery store to
tell of all that had happened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clarence Conant was utterly left. He tried to
excuse himself to Dora Vincent and the other
young ladies, but they would have nothing to do
with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The next time I go out it will be with somebody
who can manage a boat, and who is brave
enough to do it, even in a storm,” said Dora, and
walked away with her lady friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beastly bad job, beastly!” muttered Clarence
to himself. “And my best sailor suit utterly
ruined, too! Oh, why did that storm have to
come up on us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this was not the end of the matter for the
dude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The row-boat that had been smashed was a
valuable one belonging to the Lakeview Boat
Club. They did not care to lose the cost of it,
and so called on Conant to pay for the same.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first he refused, but when they threatened
arrest he weakened. It took nearly three weeks of
his salary to square accounts, and then the young
man was utterly crushed. He never went sailing
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It did not take Harry long to recover from the
effects of his outing on the lake. Inside of a week
he was as well as ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>
Blumpo took good care to tell every one of all
that had happened, and on every side Jerry was
praised for his daring work in saving the Cutwater
and his chum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have spoken of the match to take place between
Jerry and Si Peters of Rockpoint. This was
postponed for two weeks on Si’s account.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Si Peters was a tall overgrown youth of eighteen,
and was generally considered to be the best
oarsman on the lake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Consequently, when a match was arranged by
the clubs to which they belonged between the pair
it was thought, even by many Lakeview people,
that Si Peters would win.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Si had one great advantage over Jerry.
His father was rich, while Jerry’s father was
poor. Consequently, while Jerry had to help on
the farm during idle hours Si Peters could go out
and practice, and thus get himself in perfect condition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was this fact that made Si think he was going
to have an easy time defeating Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, unknown to him, Jerry got more time than
he thought. Harry was anxious to have his chum
win, and spoke to his father about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, Mr. Parker and Si Peters’ father were not
on good terms, and the former readily agreed to a
plan Harry proposed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Upton,” he said one evening, when he met
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>
Jerry’s father down in the town, “I would like to
hire Jerry to work for me every afternoon for a
couple of weeks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Mr. Parker,” said Jerry’s father,
promptly. “When do you want him to come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow, if he can. I’ll pay you five dollars
a week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well. You can pay Jerry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it was settled, and every afternoon the young
oarsman went over to the Parker place, which
bordered on the lake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here Jerry would practice in secret in a little
cove seldom visited by any boats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the time grew close for the race between
Jerry and Si Peters the boat clubs began to bet on
their favorites.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So sure were the Rockpointers that they would
win, that they gave the Lakeview people heavy
odds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Together the two clubs put up as a trophy a
silver cup, which later on would be engraved with
the name of the winner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course, Jerry’s father soon found out what
his son was doing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he would not break his bargain with Mr.
Parker, and so let Jerry practice every afternoon,
feeling sure that Jerry would not take the money
the rich manufacturer had offered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will win,” said Harry, confidently.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>
“I shall try my best,” returned Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Si Peters and his friends smiled broadly whenever
they came over to Lakeview.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jerry Upton won’t be in it after the first quarter,”
said they.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The race was to be a mile, half a mile each way,
the turning point being a well-known rocky island
scarcely fifty feet in diameter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry kept at his practice steadily until the
great day for the race arrived.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>THE SINGLE SHELL RACE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The race had been spoken of so much that Lakeview
presented a holiday appearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All those who could, crossed over from Rockpoint,
and many came from other places.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lake was crowded with craft of all sorts, and
even standing room along the shore was at a
premium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even Farmer Upton grew interested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must win that race, son,” he said. “Not
only for your own sake, but for the sake of the
whole Lakeview district.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this made Jerry more determined to win
than ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The race was not to come off until three o’clock
in the afternoon. In the meanwhile there were
half a dozen other contests, in which, however, the
masses took but small interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While one of these contests was going on, and
Jerry was in the dressing room of the boathouse
putting on his rowing rig, Harry came in excitedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>
“Jerry, you want to be on your guard,” he said
in a low tone, so that those standing about might
not hear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On guard? How?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Against Si Peters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From what I have overheard, I imagine there
is a plot on foot to make you lose the race.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What sort of a plot?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young oarsman gazed at his chum in perplexity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have you heard? I don’t know what to
make of this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know Wash Crosby?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. He is Si Peters’ toady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I heard him tell Browling that it was a
dead sure thing Si would win.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That might have been mere blowing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Browling thought so, too, but then
Crosby whispered in his ear. At once Browling’s
face took on a look of cunning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Can you do it?’ he asked, and Crosby said he
could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then Browling said he would put out his
money on Si, if he could find anyone to bet. You
know the whole crowd is rich.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and I know another thing!” exclaimed
Jerry suddenly. “I fancy I can see through their
plan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>
“What?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Crosby owns a steam launch, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is to prevent him from running the
launch so that I shall get all the swash? It would
make me lose a quarter minute or more, and perhaps
upset me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jiminey crickets! I believe you are right!”
whispered Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did they mention the steam launch?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They did. Browling said he would go and
take a look at her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then that is what the plot is, you may be sure
of it. You ought to be able to stop them, Harry.
You are going to be on your uncle’s naptha
launch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will! If they get too close to you I’ll boathook
them and pull them off!” cried Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But beware, Jerry, the plot may not be that
after all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll keep my eyes open,” replied the young
oarsman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A minute after this Harry went off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Jerry, having donned his rowing outfit,
was surrounded by the other members of the club.
His shell was inspected and found in perfect condition.
It had been guarded carefully, and now
the club members did not dare to let their eyes off
of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>
“Bring me my blades, please,” said Jerry, and
they were at once brought from the locker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He began to examine them from end to end.
Suddenly he uttered a cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Boys, look here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s up, Jerry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This one has been strained and cracked. An
extra hard pull on it, and it would give out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A murmur arose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who did this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some enemy wants Jerry to lose, sure!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>How the blade had got into that condition was
a mystery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now was no time to speculate on the affair.
A new set of blades must be procured at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Luckily there was a pair belonging to a private
party to be had. They were just the same size
and weight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would rather have my own, but I’ll make
these do, and beat them in spite of all,” said
Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At a given signal six of the boat club boys
marched down the float carrying Jerry’s shell,
which had been polished and oiled until it shone
like a mirror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a faint splash the shell dropped into the
water. Then Jerry ran down and stepped in.
His feet were “locked,” and the oars were handed
over.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>
“Hurrah for Jerry Upton!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s the boy to win!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurrah for Si Peters!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jerry won’t be in it with Si!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He will!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so the talking and the shouting ran on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Si Peters had emerged from the
landing at a private boathouse some distance up
the lake shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He received a hearty shout as he moved slowly
over to the starting point.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illo-2.jpg' alt='scroll' id='iid-0008' style='width:600px;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>THE SINGLE SHELL RACE.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Si Peters won the choice of positions, and, of
course, took the inside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The race should have been a mile straightway,
but the original challenge which led to the race
had been for a half mile going and the same
coming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon the two boys were in position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ready?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a dead silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bang!</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were off! Both boys caught the water at
the same instant. Each pulled a long but quick
stroke. Ten yards were covered, and they remained
side by side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pull, Si!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go it, Jerry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like two clocks, so far as regularity went, the
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>
two contestants bent their backs and pulled with
might and main.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One thing was certain, unless something happened,
it would be a close race.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now the Lakeview boys were getting wild.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See Jerry! He is gaining.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jerry is five feet and more in the lead!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was true. Slowly but surely our hero was
forging ahead. Should he be able to keep this up
he would cross Si Peters’ course at the turning
point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now Wash Crosby showed his hand. Without
so much as a toot of the whistle, his steam
launch kept drawing closer and closer to Jerry’s
side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then it gradually went ahead, until Jerry was
caught in the swash of the tiny waves it produced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under ordinary circumstances these waves
would not have been noticed, but in a shell, and
especially during a race, even such apparent trifles
count heavily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep off!” shouted the young oarsman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mind your business!” shouted Wash Crosby
in return, but so lowly that no one but Jerry
could hear him. “This is Si Peters’ race!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>WHO WON THE SHELL RACE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry saw at once that he had been right in
imagining that this was the plot against him.
Wash Crosby intended to keep just close enough
to cause him trouble without actually fouling him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Already the swash from the steam launch was
telling on Jerry’s lead. Si Peters kept up at his
best and soon was once more abreast of our hero.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurrah!” came from the shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Si Peters leads!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said he would win!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That steam launch is too close to Jerry
Upton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense! Don’t croak because you are going
to lose the race,” shouted Browling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lakeview boys began to look glum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now something happened that Wash Crosby
had not calculated upon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Straight from across the lake came the naptha
launch belonging to Harry Parker’s uncle. In the
bow stood Harry, boathook in hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the launch was within three yards of the
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>
Crosby craft she came to a halt. Wash Crosby
was so interested in watching the race that he did
not notice what was going on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry threw the boathook and it caught fast in
the steam launch’s stern. Then the naptha
launch was moved back, and away she went, carrying
the steam launch with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She could do this because Crosby did not have
on a full head of steam.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Astonished at the turn of affairs, Wash Crosby
looked around to see what was the matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hi! what are you doing?” he bellowed to
Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hauling you off,” returned Jerry’s chum. “I
know your plot, Wash Crosby; but it is not going
to work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let go there!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much! You’ll keep your distance from
Jerry Upton’s shell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would like to know who made you my master!”
stormed Crosby, in a perfect rage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you don’t come away I’ll report you and get
the town to lynch you,” retorted Harry, valiantly.
“Don’t you dare to touch that boathook.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, Wash Crosby did dare. But as long
as the line attached was taut he could not loosen
it. Then he tried new tactics. He put on a full
head of steam.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a tug of war between the steam and
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>
the naptha launches, and for the moment it was
hard to tell which would come off victorious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Harry’s craft was more powerful than
Crosby’s, and soon the steam launch was carried
far away from the racing shells.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wash Crosby was furious and would have eaten
Harry up could he have gotten at the lad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll fix you for this!” he cried and threw a
heavy chunk of coal at Harry’s head, which the
boy dodged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t try that again, Wash Crosby, or I’ll
retaliate in a way you least expect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You had no right to haul me off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You had no right to interfere with Jerry
Upton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wash Crosby grumbled but could do nothing.
Harry calmly proceeded to hold him back until
the race was almost over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meanwhile, how was Jerry faring?</p>

<p class='pindent'>With long, quick strokes, he swept on, side by
side with Si Peters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was going to be a close contest, and the spectators
along the lake front went wild with enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t let up, Si!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Show the Rockpointers what you can do,
Jerry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A dollar that Si wins by a length!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A dollar that Jerry wins by two lengths!”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>
At last the two reached Rocky Island, which
formed the turning point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were still side by side, but Si had the
inner turn all to himself, while Jerry had to move
about in a much larger area.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This brought Jerry a good length behind Si
Peters when the return was begun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Si Peters saw this and grinned to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ain’t in it a little bit, Jerry Upton!” he
called out, but Jerry did not reply. He was not
foolish enough to waste breath just then in talking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over the smooth water swept the two long
shells, each boy working with quick and long
strokes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the finishing stake was in view. Si Peters
still kept his lead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s Si’s race, no doubt of it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t I say Jerry Upton wouldn’t be in it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does Cornfield know about rowing, anyhow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But scarcely had the last remark been made
when Jerry began to increase his stroke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly but surely his shell began to overlap that
of Si Peters. Now he was half-way up, now three-quarters,
now they were even!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See him gaining!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look! look! Jerry is ahead!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He can’t keep that stroke! It’s enough to kill
him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>
“Can’t he? Look, he is actually walking away
from Si.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry was now “letting himself out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like a flash he swept past Si Peters and reached
the finish two and a half lengths ahead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A rousing cheer from the Lakeview boys greeted
him, while the Rockpointers were as mum as
oysters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Si Peters looked decidedly crestfallen. For several
minutes he had nothing to say. Then some
of his friends whispered into his ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must do it, Si,” said one of the number.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, I will,” replied Peters doggedly, and
hurried to the judges’ boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I claim a foul!” he cried out loudly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every one was astonished, and none more so
than Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where were you fouled?” asked one of the
judges.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Up at the turning point.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is a falsehood!” cried Jerry indignantly.
“I never came anywhere near you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m telling the truth,” said Si Peters. “If he
hadn’t fouled me I would have beaten with ease.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>A PRISONER OF THE ENEMY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>At once a loud murmur arose. Some sided with
Jerry, while others took Si Peters’ part.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From hot words the boys of the rival towns
almost came to blows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the midst of the quarrel a row-boat came
down the lake carrying two elderly and well-known
gentlemen, both residents of Rockpoint. Curious
to know the cause of the trouble, the gentlemen
came up to the judges’ craft, now moored along
shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peters claims a foul up at the turning point,”
said some one of the gentlemen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean up at the island?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was no foul there. Was there,
Greenley?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None at all,” replied the second gentleman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These assertions attracted attention. On inquiry
it was learned that the two gentlemen had
been up at the island fishing. They had watched
the race in the meanwhile, and they were willing
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>
to make affidavit that Jerry had not interfered in
the slightest degree with Si Peters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He took the outside, and he really gave Peters
more room than was necessary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two gentlemen were too well known to be
doubted in what they said, and at once the judges
refused to accept Si Peters’ plea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The race goes to Jerry Upton, who won it
fairly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then how Jerry’s friends did yell with delight!
The lad was pounced upon and raised up on his
friends’ shoulders, and away went the boat club
boys around the town, Blumpo in advance of
them blowing a big fish-horn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You is de boy!” said the homeless youth.
“You is de best oarsman on de lake!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry was in the crowd, and when he told how
he had outwitted Wash Crosby every one roared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The race, however, made lots of ill-feeling. The
Rockpoint boys could not stand defeat, and that
evening half a dozen rows started in as many different
places.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sticks and stones were freely used, and many
boys went home with their arms and heads tied
up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry became involved in one of the worst of
the fights in rather a peculiar manner. He was on
his way home rather late, thinking all was over
and that the Rockpointers had departed, when he
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>
heard a hoarse cry for help from down a side
street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He recognized the voice as that of Blumpo
Brown, and at once hurried to the spot, there to
find the youth at the mercy of four of the Rockpoint
boys, including Wash Crosby, Si Peters, and
two others named Banner and Graves. The quartet
had poor Blumpo down on his back and were
kicking him as hard as they could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You cowards!” shouted Jerry as he rushed up,
“to kick a fellow when he’s down!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is none of your affair,” shouted Si Peters.
“He insulted us, and we won’t take an insult from
anybody, much less an Indian coon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Da jess pitched inter me!” howled Blumpo.
“Sabe me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let up, I say!” went on Jerry, and, clutching
Si Peters by the shoulder, he flung the big Rockpointer
flat on his back several feet away. Then
Jerry pitched into the others of the crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This gave Blumpo a chance to rise. He scrambled
up and let out a long and loud yell for help.
Luckily, some other boys were not far away.
They heard the cry and arrived on a run.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must skip now!” cried Wash Crosby to Si
Peters. “We’ll have the whole town on us in another
minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hang the luck!” howled Peters. “But just
wait, Jerry Upton, I’ll get square with you yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span>
He turned away with his friends, and the quartet
scooted for the lake, with Jerry, Blumpo, and half
a dozen others at their heels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wash Crosby’s launch was tied up at a dock,
and into this they tumbled. The line was cut, and
off they steamed, amid a perfect shower of stones,
lumps of dirt, old bottles, and anything that came
handy to the Lakeview boys’ reach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, I fancy that’s the end of them,” said
Jerry. “I thought they had gone long ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Da laid for me!” groaned Blumpo. “Wish I
dun had a hoss pistol, I would shoot ’em all full of
holes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon the steam launch faded away in the darkness,
and a little later found Jerry again on his
way home. Of course his folks were proud to
think he had won the race.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My boy, Jerry!” was all Mrs. Upton said, but
the way she said it meant a good deal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a week later that the boat club gave a
reception, at which Jerry was the lion. He was
presented with the silver trophy, and made a neat
little speech. There were refreshments and music,
and altogether the affair was the most brilliant
Lakeview had seen for some time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Matters moved along slowly for a week after the
racing and the reception were over. Jerry worked
on the farm, and never was there a more industrious
youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>
In the meanwhile Harry Parker made several
arrangements for the outing up the lake, in which
Jerry and Blumpo were to accompany him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day Mr. Upton received a letter from Rockpoint.
It was from a friend, and asked if the
farmer could send him over at once a load of hay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t go very well,” said Mr. Upton. “Supposing
you take it over to Mr. Dike, Jerry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will, sir,” replied Jerry, promptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young oarsman had not been over to Rockpoint
since the races, but he thought he could go
over and come back without encountering trouble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hay was soon loaded on the rick, and then
Jerry started off for the other shore. He was compelled
to drive nearly to the lower end of the lake
to cross on the bridge, consequently it was well on
toward the middle of the afternoon when Rockpoint
was reached.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He and Mr. Dike put the load in the barn, and
after being paid, and partaking of a glass of cold
milk and a piece of home-made pie, Jerry, at just
six o’clock, started on the return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had been a gloomy day, and, consequently,
it was already growing dark, although it was
midsummer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Jerry knew the way well, so he did not
mind the darkness. He let the team go their own
gait, and took it easy in the rick on a couple of
horse blankets.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span>
He was in a sort of day dream, when suddenly,
his team was stopped by a couple of boys, who
sprang from behind a clump of trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys wore masks over their faces, and when
they spoke, they did their best to disguise their
voices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry sprang up in alarm. At the same time
four more boys, also masked, surrounded the
hay-rick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the meaning of this?” demanded Jerry.
“Let go of those horses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instead of replying, the two boys continued to
hold the team. The other four leaped into the
hay-rick and fell on Jerry. Taken so suddenly,
he was at a disadvantage. Hardly could he make
a move before one of the boys struck him on the
head with a club, dazing him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then a rope was brought forth, and Jerry’s
hands were tied behind him and he was thrown on
the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys sent the team on their way, trusting
to luck that the horses would find their way home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you going to do with me?” asked
Jerry, when he found himself bound and helpless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll soon see, Jerry Upton,” came from the
leader, in such a muffled voice that our hero tried
in vain to recognize the speaker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Make him march!” said another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, march!”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>
Into the woods the masked gang hurried Jerry.
When he attempted to turn back, they hit him
with their sticks and tripped him up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, when he would go no further, four of
the boys picked him up and carried him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nearly a quarter of an hour was spent in this
manner, and the party reached a little clearing.
On three sides were tall trees, and on the fourth a
wall of rocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the spot,” cried the leader. “Now tie
him to a tree and get the stuff out of the cave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At once the young oarsman was bound to a tree
on the edge of the clearing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then two of the boys entered a cave between the
rocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon they came forth with a pot filled with a
thick, black liquid and two big pillows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At once Jerry realized what his captors meant
to do. They were going to tar and feather him!</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>TAR AND FEATHERS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The prospect was far from pleasant to our hero.
In spite of his bravery, he shivered as he saw the
gang of masked boys start up a fire over which to
heat the tar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you intend to tar and feather me,” he said
to the leader.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve struck it, Jerry Upton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Si Peters, do it, and you shall go to
prison, mark my words.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry had only guessed at the identity of the
leader, but he had hit upon the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who told you I was”—began Peters, and broke
off short. “You’re mistaken,” he went on in his
assumed voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not mistaken, Si Peters. I know you,
and you had best remember what I say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you’re too fresh, Upton, and we’re going
to teach you a lesson,” put in another of the
crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A good coat of tar and feathers is just what
your system needs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>
“We’ll paint you up so artistically that, even
your own mother won’t know you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not if I can help it,” muttered Jerry, under his
breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great mass of wood had been collected, and
this gave a roaring fire and also afforded a good
light for the workers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On each side of the fire a notched stick was driven
into the ground. A third stick was laid across
the top, just beyond the flames. From this upper
stick the pot of tar was suspended by an iron
chain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The heat soon began to tell on the tar. As it
softened it could be smelled a long distance off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you like that smell?” asked Peters of
Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s a good enough smell,” replied our hero,
as coolly as he could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never had a dose of tar before, did you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t had this dose yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s so, but you soon will have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you can’t escape us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much, he can’t,” put in another, and now
Jerry felt sure that the speaker was Wash Crosby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll talk about that later, Crosby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The masked boy started back and denied his
identity. But it was plain to see he was much put
out.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>
“I know you, Peters, Crosby, Banner and
Graves,” went on Jerry. “And I’ll discover who
you other two fellows are before I leave here, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fiddlesticks!” shouted one of the boys by the
fire who was stirring the tar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it getting soft?” asked Crosby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is the brush?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got it,” spoke up another, and he held up
the stump of an old whitewash brush.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At a signal from Peters the crowd of masked
boys withdrew to the side of the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here a long talk followed. It was so low that
Jerry could not hear a word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peters was making the crowd solemnly promise
that they would not inform upon each other, no
matter what happened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we stick together, Upton can prove nothing,”
he said. “He has no witnesses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right you are, Si.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We want to get square, and this is the chance
of our lives to do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can give him the tar and feathers and then
leave him tied up in such a fashion that he can get
free, but not before we have had a chance to make
good our escape and get home and to bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the way to fix it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will teach Lakeporters a good lesson,” put
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>
in one of the unknowns. “My! but ain’t I down
on every one of ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so am I!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meanwhile the young oarsman was trying
his best to work himself free of his bonds. He felt
that unless he escaped he would surely be tarred
and feathered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tugged at the ropes around his body, and
after a hard struggle he managed to free his left
arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His right arm followed, although this cost him a
bad cut on the wrist, from which the blood flowed
freely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he gave the wound no thought, and in haste
began to work at the rope at his waist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now that was loosened, only the one around his
knees remained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked anxiously toward the fire. The
masked boys were still in deep discussion, and not
a single eye was directed toward the prisoner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh, for three minutes more time!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He worked with feverish haste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now he was practically free!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Si Peters turned and beheld him as he took a
step behind the tree, out of the glare of the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has got away, fellows!” he shouted. “After
him, quick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>
A yell went up, and the crowd rushed forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He mustn’t escape us!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We worked too hard to capture him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See, he is limping! The rope is still fastened to
one of his legs!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like a pack of wolves after a rabbit they came
after Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our hero did his best to out-distance them, and
he would have succeeded had it not been for the
rope around one knee, which caught in a tree root
and threw him down flat on his face. In another
moment the crowd was on top of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They showed him no mercy. Si Peters was particularly
brutal and kicked Jerry heavily in the
side half a dozen times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll teach you to crawl away, you sneak!” he
cried. “You can’t fool us in this fashion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The kicks stunned Jerry and deprived him of his
wind. He fought as best he could, but he was no
match for six strong boys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again he was overpowered. Then the gang
dragged him to the side of the roaring camp fire
and threw off their masks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now we’ll strip him,” said Wash Crosby.
“The tar is all ready and so are the feathers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry’s struggles availed him nothing. His coat
and vest were literally ripped from his body, and
his shirt followed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me the brush. I want to give him the
first dose,” sang out Si Peters.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>
The old whitewash brush was handed to the
leader. Si dipped it deeply into the pot of hot tar,
and approached the young oarsman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Jerry Upton, we’ll tar and feather you in
spite of your threats,” he said.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>WHAT TOWSER DID.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, by creation? what does this mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The speaker was Mr. Upton, Jerry’s father. He
was gazing at the hay-rick, which was coming
down the road to the barn at a lively gait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the boys who had captured Jerry had
thought, the horses had found their way home
alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anxiously, Mr. Upton looked around for Jerry,
and then he stopped the team and put them up in
the barn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Running into the house he told his wife of the
state of affairs. Instantly Mrs. Upton grew
alarmed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps they ran away and threw Jerry out!”
she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It ain’t likely they could get away with Jerry,”
replied Mr. Upton. “But I allow it is curious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A half hour went by, and the farmer determined
to start on a hunt for his son. He went off on
horseback, and took with him Towser, the farm
dog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Towser was an old and faithful animal, a prime
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>
favorite with Jerry, and he trotted along beside
the horse as if he knew something was wrong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We want to find Jerry, Towser,” said Mr. Upton.
“Jerry, Towser, Jerry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the dog wagged his tail as if to say that he
understood perfectly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was now quite dark. The farmer had
brought along a lantern, and this he lit and
swung around first on one side of the road and
then on the other. As he journeyed along he remembered
Jerry’s troubles with the Rockpoint
boys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe he has had another fight,” he thought.
“It was foolish to let him go over there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Inside of an hour the other side of the lake
was reached, and they struck the lonely road leading
into Rockpoint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the farmer went on he became more and
more sober in mind. He seemed to feel in his mind
that something was wrong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Towser let out a mournful howl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jerry, Towser, Jerry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the dog howled. Then he came to an unexpected
halt and although Farmer Upton went
on, the dog refused to budge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, Towser?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For reply the dog started into the bushes, and
this at first made the old farmer angry, for he did
not understand the dog.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>
“Come, Towser!” he cried. “We are not after
game just now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the dog would not come. He wanted to
enter the brush.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last Mr. Upton went to catch him by the
collar, but just as he did so the dog gave a short
bark and picked up something from among the
bushes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No wonder the old farmer was surprised. The
article Towser had discovered was a sling-shot
Jerry often carried with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Must have come in here,” mused Farmer
Upton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then of a sudden he began to examine the
ground. It was soft in spots and plainly showed
the footmarks of Jerry and the Si Peters crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s in trouble!” said the old farmer to himself.
“Maybe some tramps have carried him off
and robbed him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Urging on the faithful dog, Mr. Upton hurried
along the path through the woods, leaving the
horse tied to a tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was an uneven way, and he stumbled many
times. But he did not mind—his one thought was
to reach his son and find out the boy’s condition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Towser ran ahead, howling dismally at every
few yards. But the faithful dog did not lose the
scent.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>
Presently, through the bushes, Farmer Upton
caught sight of a distant camp fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hist!” he called to Towser. “Go slow, now!
Down!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the dog obeyed and howled no longer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A hundred yards more were passed, when a loud
cry rent the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Help! help!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Jerry’s voice. Si Peters was in the act of
applying the first brushful of tar to his back.
Utterly helpless, there was nothing left for Jerry to
do but to use his lungs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shut up!” cried Si Peters. “Yell again and I’ll
hit you in the mouth with the tar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are an overgrown coward!” retorted
Jerry. “Give me a fair show, and I’ll knock you
out in short order.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And again he called for help.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a rage, Si Peters started to plaster Jerry’s
mouth with the hot tar. But ere the brush could
descend, Mr. Upton and Towser burst upon the
scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop, you young scamps!” roared the old
farmer. “At ’em, Towser! Chew ’em up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Startled at the unexpected interruption, the
rowdies fell back. Then Towser leaped forward
and caught Si Peters by his trowsers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Save me!” yelled Si, in terror. “The dog is
going to chew me up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>
“Good, Towser!” returned Jerry. “Hold him
fast!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Towser did as bidden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime Mr. Upton ran after the boys
who had been holding Jerry. He caught two of
them, and before they knew it, knocked their heads
together so forcibly that they saw stars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry, delighted at the unexpected turn of
affairs, turned upon Wash Crosby. Si Peters had
dropped the tar brush, and this Jerry secured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bang! whack! Crosby received a blow over the
head, and one in the ear, which left a big black
streak of tar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, don’t! please don’t!” he screamed.
“Let up, Jerry! It was only a joke! We weren’t
really going to tar and feather you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the fellow ran for his very life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During this time Si Peters was trying his best to
get away from Towser, who held on with a deathlike
grip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Around and around the camp fire the two circled,
until Jerry came up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The youth called off the dog and went at Si in
about the same manner as he had treated Wash
Crosby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Si wanted to run for it, and in his hurry rushed
through the fire, knocking over the kettle of tar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sticky mess emptied itself over his clothing.
Then the young oarsman tripped him up, and over
he rolled among the loose feathers.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>
“Now you can see how you like it!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And growling and panting for breath, Si Peters
ran away after the others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Rockpoint rowdies were thoroughly demoralized.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>OFF FOR HERMIT ISLAND.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>It took Jerry and his father some little time to
get back their breath sufficiently to leave the
woods and make their way to the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You came in the nick of time, father,” said the
lad. “In another five minutes I would have
been tarred and feathered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me about the whole affair, son,” said the
old farmer; and Jerry did so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The good-for-nothing rascals!” cried the old
farmer. “If they touch you again I’ll have ’em
all up before the squire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That won’t help us, father,” replied Jerry.
“They are rich, you know. They would get off
somehow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’ll take it out of their hides.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Upton told how Towser had led the way
into the woods. Jerry had always loved the farm
dog, but now he thought more of him than ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good boy,” he said. “You shall go with us
when we take our outing—that is, if father will
let you go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>
“Yes, Jerry, take him along. He may help you
out of some more trouble,” replied Mr. Upton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was rather late when they arrived home.
Mrs. Upton was shocked to learn of what had occurred,
but glad to learn that Jerry had escaped
his enemies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day the young oarsman told Harry
Parker and the other boys of his adventure. Harry
was very indignant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those Rockpoint boys ought to be driven out
of the state.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dun racken I’ll carry my hoss pistol after
dis,” said Blumpo. “Da don’t cotch dis chile for
to tar and feather him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A week later Jerry, Harry, and Blumpo started
up the lake on a ten days’ outing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were in Harry’s largest row-boat, the one
that had a sail, and carried with them a tent and
a good stock of ammunition. Jerry and Harry
were armed with guns, and Blumpo carried his
“hoss pistol” and a rusty spear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were bound for Hermit Island, a wild but
beautiful patch of land situated almost at the end
of Otasco Lake. The island was so called because
it was said by some that the place was inhabited
by an old hermit who lived in a cave and never
showed himself to visitors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some did not believe this story, for try as hard
as they could, they had never been able to locate
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>
the strange creature, who was said to have a white
beard to his waist, and white hair equally long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day that the trio started away was a fine
one, and the boys were in excellent spirits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I trust we have no more squalls,” remarked
Harry, as they glided along, the sail set and the
oars out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No storm to-day,” returned Jerry. “We are
going to have at least three or four days of fine
weather.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, I wondah if I could shoot a bar wid dis
yere gun,” put in Blumpo, as he held up his pistol.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might if you threw the pistol at the bear
when you pulled the trigger,” laughed Jerry.
“Sure as you are born, Blumpo, that pistol will
go to pieces if you try to fire it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Den I’ll fire it dis way,” replied the homeless
youth, and swung the weapon as if to heave it
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour passed, during which the boys laid their
plans for a camp and talked over what they would
do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope we have good hunting and fishing,” said
Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I,” returned Harry. “And I likewise
hope we find the hermit, if there really is such a
creature.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe he won’t want us on his island,” put in
Blumpo. “He may be an ugly feller.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>
“We’ll risk it, Blumpo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ain’t in fer stirrin’ up no hornets’ nest,” went
on the homeless youth. “I jess like ter lay
around an’ take it easy under de trees—a-listening
to—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘The tumble bugs tumbling around,’ as the
song says,” laughed Jerry. “Blumpo, you must
get more ambition in you. Come, row up lively.
It’s a good long distance to the island, and we
must make it before sundown.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All three braced up, and the big boat went forward
at an increased rate of speed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo!” cried Harry, presently. “Jerry,
doesn’t that look like Si Peters’ yacht?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Harry pointed over to the west shore of the
lake, where a craft had just emerged from behind a
small headland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the Peters yacht, sure enough,” replied
Jerry, after studying the craft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If she cums dis way, we’ll hab lively times,” remarked
Blumpo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s true, Blumpo. Come, maybe we can
get away from her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys kept steadily on their course, and for a
long time those on the yacht seemed to pay no
attention to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But after awhile the big boat put on another
tack, and fifteen minutes later it was within hailing
distance. Then they saw that Si Peters and
<span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>
Crosby were in possession. They had with them
five other Rockpoint lads, including Banner and
Graves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hi, you fellows, stop rowing!” yelled Peters at
the top of his voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mind your own business, Si Peters,” retorted
Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t stop?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Leave us alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We want you to give up Jerry Upton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give him up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly. Come up alongside and let him jump
on board of the yacht.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s as cool as a cake of ice!” cried Jerry.
“You want everything, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are going to get square with you, Jerry
Upton!” put in Wash Crosby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us pull away as fast as we can,” whispered
Harry. “Those chaps mean trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dat’s de talk,” said Blumpo, who was the
worst scared of the three.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They bent to their oars, and soon moved off a
hundred feet or more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Si Peters ran out to the jib of the yacht.
“Stop!” he commanded. “Pull another yard
and you’ll be sorry for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll risk it,” replied Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll run you down!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t dare!” yelled Harry, in alarm.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>
“Won’t we? Just see if we won’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At once Si Peters gave some directions to Wash
Crosby, who was at the wheel. The course of the
yacht was slightly changed, and now the craft was
headed directly for the boat containing our
friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anudder smash-up, shuah as you’re born!”
groaned Blumpo, and he prepared to leap into the
lake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stay where you are!” ordered Jerry. “I’ll
check their little game.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reaching into a locker, the young oarsman
brought out his gun. Leaping on one of the seats,
he pointed the weapon at Si Peters’ head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sheer off!” he cried. “Sheer off, or I’ll fire on
you!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>AN ATTACK IN THE DARK.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Si Peters was nearly dumbfounded at the unexpected
turn affairs had taken. The bully at once
gave the necessary directions, and the yacht
passed to windward of the other boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A good idea, Jerry!” exclaimed Harry. “That
will make them steer clear of us for good, I
reckon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If they haven’t got guns of their own, Harry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys on the yacht were evidently much
crestfallen. They had hoped to get Jerry in their
power, but that plan was defeated. They dropped
behind several hiding places, and again headed
for the big row-boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But once more Jerry outwitted them. Calling to
Blumpo to steady the temporary mast, he climbed
to the top, his gun slung over his shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From this elevated point he was able to sweep
the yacht’s deck from stem to stern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now turn about, or I’ll fire on you, as sure as
fate!” he ordered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think you are smart, don’t you,” sneered
Wash Crosby.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>
“I’m too smart for your crowd,” retorted Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can fire as well as you,” put in Graves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you had a gun, which you haven’t,” retorted
Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys on the yacht growled among themselves,
but could do nothing. Wash Crosby tried
to throw a piece of iron on the row-boat, but it
fell short. Then Harry retaliated by shooting
through the yacht’s main-sail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seeing the boys on the big row-boat meant business,
Si Peters and his crowd withdrew from the
encounter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as they were gone, Jerry came down
from his perch, and off they started once more for
the island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The yacht sailed so far off they thought they
were no longer observed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in this they were mistaken for Si Peters had
a field glass with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This glass was now brought into play, and
Peters’ crowd kept track of Jerry and the others
until the vicinity of Hermit Island was reached.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Going to camp there,” said Wash Crosby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It ought to give us a fine chance to get
square,” replied Si Peters, and the crowd began to
plot against our hero and his friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in the meantime the big row-boat disappeared
behind the bushes which fringed a narrow
inlet, and, try their best, those on the yacht could
not locate it again.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>
“Never mind, we’ll come up some other day,”
said Si Peters. “It’s getting too late to do anything
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the yacht returned to Rockpoint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Harry who selected a landing place on
Hermit’s Island. He found a smooth, sandy
beach, and here the row-boat was drawn up well
out of the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Back of the beach was a little clearing. On one
side were tall rocks, and on the other the woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As good a place as any to pitch the tent,”
said Jerry. “Come, Blumpo, stir yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tent was brought out and put up, and a
camp fire was lit. While Blumpo gathered brush
to put into the tent to sleep on, Jerry and Harry
tried their hands at fishing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon Harry had a bite, and brought in a perch
weighing a little over a half a pound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good for you, Harry, you take first prize!”
cried Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardly had he spoken when he felt a jerk.
There was a lively struggle for fully a minute,
and then Jerry landed his catch—a rock bass, all
of a pound in weight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Second, but best,” laughed Harry. “I guess
that is all we want for to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pan was over the fire getting hot. Blumpo
cleaned the fish and put them on. In the meantime,
Jerry made a pot of coffee.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>
Never had a meal tasted better to the boys.
They lingered over the scraps for a long while,
talking over the events of the day. Blumpo also
gave them a song. It was a happy time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Somebody ought to stand guard all night, I
suppose,” said Jerry, when it came time to turn in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, nonsense!” cried Harry. “Who is going
to hurt us in this out of the way spot?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We don’t know what may be around.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’se too tired to watch,” put in Blumpo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never knew the time you weren’t tired,”
laughed Jerry. “But let it go, if you wish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quarter of an hour later all of the boys had
turned in. Blumpo picked out a corner of the tent
nearest the rear. Harry slept in the middle, while
Jerry took up a place not far from the front flaps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As it was rather warm, they left one of the flaps
open to admit the air. Jerry lay in such a position
that he could look out on the smoldering
camp fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry was as tired as the rest, and it did not
take him long to drop off into a sound sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How long he slept he did not know. A low noise
outside aroused him. He opened his eyes with a
start, wondering what it was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then came another growl or grunt, he could not
tell which. He sat up and looked outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sight met his gaze that nearly caused his heart
to stop beating. The camp fire was almost out,
<span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>
but beyond its fitful glare he beheld a pair of large
eyes bent directly upon the tent opening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eyes belonged to some savage beast which
was about to attack the camp.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>JERRY’S SHOT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry realized that he and his friends were in
great peril. What the savage beast outside was
he could not tell, but it looked large and powerful
in the gloom beyond the camp fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no time to lose if anything was to be
done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Luckily, before lying down, the young oarsman
had loaded his gun and hung it up on the front
pole of the tent, within easy reach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sitting up, he now took the weapon and pulled
back the trigger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The click reached the ears of the animal outside,
and once again it let out that peculiar sound,
neither grunt nor growl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Jerry put the gun to his shoulder, and,
taking aim at one of the shining eyes, fired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bang!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The report of the firearm caused Harry and
Blumpo to spring up in wild alarm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heaben sabe us!” moaned Blumpo.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span>
“A wild animal outside,” cried Jerry. “Get
your gun, quick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry leaped for his weapon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t make out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reloading as rapidly as he could, our hero
dashed into the open. A howl of pain told he had
hit his mark. The beast had turned and was
crashing through the brush close to the rocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us find out what it was!” cried Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doan go!” moaned Blumpo. “You will git
chewed up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then he dove back into the tent for his
“hoss” pistol and his rusty spear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catching up a blazing brand, Jerry threw it into
the brush. By the light they saw the creature
crouching on a rock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bang! bang!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two guns spoke simultaneously. Harry hit
the beast in the shoulder. Jerry’s shot was more
effective for it struck in the neck, and with a snarl
the creature leaped into the air and fell—dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve settled him!” cried Harry. “Come on
and inspect him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait and load your gun first,” cautioned our
hero. “He may have some fight in him still.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The weapons were put in order, and then, with
firebrands to light the way, they moved forward
to inspect their victim.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>
It was a large and heavy boar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A wild hog!” shouted Jerry. “My, what a
big fellow he is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought it was a bear,” said Harry. He was
somewhat disappointed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was savage enough, at all events,” replied
Jerry. “These wild hogs put up a terrible fight,
father says.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I know that. Wasn’t Dick Harben’s uncle
killed by one? Well, he’s dead enough and we
have meat to last a month.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pretty strong eating,” smiled Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They called Blumpo. The homeless youth was
delighted over the dead animal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Ham’s de best ob meat,’ ” he sang. “I’ll soon
fix him up, see if I don’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys were glad that it was getting toward
morning, for the excitement had taken all the
sleep out of them. They replenished the fire, and
sat around waiting for daybreak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as the sun rose, Blumpo prepared breakfast,
while Jerry and Harry took a plunge into the
lake. It was great sport, and they remained in
the water until Blumpo called them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That day the boys tramped nearly two miles
around the island. They took their guns with
them and came back with their game bags full of
birds. Returning, they were thoroughly tired out,
but nevertheless resolved to set a watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>
“Four hours each,” said Harry, and this was
agreed to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But nothing happened to disturb them, and on
the following night the watch was abandoned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys put in nearly a week in hunting, fishing,
swimming, and lying around, and they enjoyed
every minute of the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing had been seen or heard of the hermit
who was supposed to inhabit the island, and they
began to think that no such person existed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neither had they heard anything more of Si
Peters and his crowd, and they fancied they were
safe from molestation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sunday passed quietly, and on Monday morning
Jerry proposed they take along a game bag full of
provisions and climb to the top of the rocky hill in
the centre of the island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must go to the very top before we leave,”
he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The game bag was filled with eatables, and cups,
plates, etc., and then they tied up the tent flaps
and drew the boat still higher up out of the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first quarter of a mile of the journey was
easy enough, but after that they struck the rocks,
and climbing became more and more difficult with
every step.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Phew! but dis am work!” puffed Blumpo.
“Dis boy’s most tucked out!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll take a good long rest at noon, Blumpo,”
said Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>
Up and up they went until Jerry, who was in advance,
came to a sudden halt. A deep split in the
rocks barred his further progress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will we have to go back?” asked Harry, anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It looks like it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t we leap over?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We might try. I can, if you are willing to follow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I kin jump dat easy enough,” put in Blumpo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry stepped back, and running a few feet, made
the leap in safety. Harry followed, and then both
boys waited for Blumpo Brown to join them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The homeless youth measured the distance with
his eye and came on like a steam engine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But just before he reached the edge of the split
he slipped and went headlong. Unable to stop
himself, he crashed down into the opening head
first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In going over the rocks he twisted himself partly
around.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With one hand he caught hold of a frail bush
growing among the rocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His left foot caught in a crevice, and there he
hung, unable to help himself, and with death staring
him in the face!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>THE HERMIT OF THE ISLAND.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll be killed!” yelled Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His face was deadly white.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Help me!” came faintly from Blumpo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before the others could realize it, Jerry had
leaped back to the other side of the opening.
Catching hold of a jutting rock with one hand, he
grasped Blumpo’s wrist with the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now let go below and I’ll haul you up,
Blumpo,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The frightened youth did as requested, and
slowly but surely Jerry dragged him up to a safe
spot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good for you, Jerry!” shouted Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By golly! but dat was a close call!” shuddered
the homeless youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, with tears in his big, honest eyes, he
wrung our hero’s hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You dun sabed my life, Jerry!” he declared
solemnly. “I won’t forgit dat, neber!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The nervous boy was averse to attempting a
<span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>
second jump, and so the party walked along the
opening until a much narrower spot was reached.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once over, the upward climb was again begun.
By noon they reckoned that they were within half
a mile of the top. But all were exhausted, and
glad enough to rest and take a bite to eat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A fine spring was found, and here they washed
up and quenched their thirst before resuming the
journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They found a large quantity of huckleberries
growing on the hillside, and these made very acceptable
eating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A fellow could put in a month here,” remarked
Jerry. “But, heigho! the vacation will soon be
ended, and then for school again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rest over, they went up and up again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beat you to the summit!” cried Jerry, and
started up the last stretch on a rush. Harry
followed, and Blumpo was not far behind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What a splendid panorama was spread before
them! They could see clear to either end of the
lake and off to the hills east and west.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see the church steeple!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look! look!” exclaimed Harry, suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pointed down the lake to where a yacht was
bowling along before the breeze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Si Peters’ boat!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if Peters knows we are still on the
island?” mused Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>
“I reckon he does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a wonder he and his crowd never came up
to make more trouble for us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps he dun got scared at dis hoss pistol
ob mine,” put in Blumpo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To him that “hoss” pistol was a mighty weapon,
greatly to be feared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little back of the summit of rocks was a
grassy plateau, and here the boys decided to
camp for the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a beautiful place for a picnic!” said
Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather hard to get to, though,” returned
Jerry. “I wonder if there is a spring handy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A spring away up heah!” exclaimed Blumpo.
“Yo’ expect watah to run up hill? Ha, ha!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Blumpo; strange as it may seem, the
finest springs are found at the very tops of mountains.
Come on and look for one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The homeless youth showed his surprise, but he
readily joined in the hunt, and so did Harry.
There was a patch of brush behind the plateau,
and this they skirted. Ere long Jerry found a
tiny rivulet flowing in a well-worn hollow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The head of this rill of water will bring us to
the spring,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They began to follow the watercourse. It led
around half a dozen big rocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Halt!”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>
All three of the boys sprang back in amazement.
From whence had that unexpected command
proceeded?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Halt, I say!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stopped short.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who are you?” asked Jerry quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am the Lonely Man. Leave me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Lonely Man,” repeated Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Depart, my boys, at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you the man they call the hermit of the
island?” asked Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I presume so. Now leave me. I have not
spoken to other men for years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We would like to get a little water first, if you
please,” said Jerry. “Surely so good an old man
as you will not refuse us that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This way of talking evidently struck the hermit’s
fancy, for there was a rustle of bushes, and
the hermit of the island stepped into view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All of the boys stared at him in blank amazement.
He was a reddish-black individual, with
snow white hair and long flowing beard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blumpo grew so frightened that he immediately
fell on his knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“De voodoo doctor, suah!” he muttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like many other ignorant people, he was very
superstitious and believed in charms and voodooism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are sorry to have disturbed you in your
lonely retreat,” began Harry. “But we—”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>
“Say no more, my boy. Get the water you
need and depart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry and Jerry turned toward the spring and
quietly filled up the big tin can they had brought
along.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old hermit watched them curiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look like good boys,” he said. “I want
to ask a favor of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” asked both boys in a breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish to end my days here undisturbed.
Will you promise not to reveal my dwelling place
to your friends?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am willing to say nothing,” said Jerry,
promptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So am I,” returned Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man looked much relieved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how is it with you?” he went on, turning
and walking to where Blumpo had his head bent
low on the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please, sah, don’t charm me, sah! don’t cast
no spell ober me!” howled Blumpo. “I ain’t dun
nuffin’ ’deed I ain’t. I’se de best boy in Lakeview!
Ain’t I, Harry? Ain’t dat de truf,
Jerry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will not harm you, so do not be afraid,” said
the hermit with a faint smile on his reddish-black
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t tell a t’ing! not a word, sah, hope ter
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>
die if I do!” went on Blumpo, still keeping his
face down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was afraid that if he looked at the hermit he
would be bewitched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blumpo, get up!” said Harry, sharply.
“Don’t make a fool of yourself. This gentleman
is not going to hurt you. Stand up and be a
man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus spoken to, the homeless boy arose slowly
to his feet. His knees were still trembling, and he
needed but little incentive to take to his heels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have not seen a colored or an Indian boy in
years,” went on the old hermit. “If you are an
honest boy let me take your hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He advanced, and with his knees knocking together
Blumpo put out his hand and looked the
old man in the face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next instant the hermit gave a leap back in
profound astonishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Abraham! As sure as the sun shines! And I
thought he was dead!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>THE HERMIT’S SECRET.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>All three of the boys were much mystified by the
old hermit’s words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He must be a little off in his head,” thought
Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is Abraham?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is Abraham!” cried the hermit. “Are
you not Abraham?” he went on to Blumpo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon not, sah. I’se jess plain Blumpo
Brown.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blumpo Brown! Ha! how well I remember
that name! You are indeed Abraham, and I am
your father!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the hermit caught Blumpo in his arms. It
is needless to say the youth was frightened and
bewildered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come to my cave and I will tell you all,”
went on the hermit, and he dragged Blumpo
along.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry and Harry willingly followed. They found
that the old man had quite a comfortable place
among the rocks. It was elaborately furnished,
showing that the hermit was well-to-do.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>
They all took seats on some skins thrown over
rude couches. The hermit made Blumpo sit close
to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My name is Daniel Brown,” he began. “And
you, Blumpo, are my only son. Your full name is
Blum-pou-la-hau,—the Indian for boy-of-the-laughing-face,—for,
you know, you have much Indian
blood in your veins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dat’s what folks said I had,” said Blumpo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you were dead—that you had been
drowned. It was this drove me to make a hermit
of myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the old hermit went into many particulars,
to which all listened with great interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blumpo could scarcely believe his ears. His face
began to expand, and a smile broke out on it, the
like of which had never before been seen. He was
a homeless waif no longer. He had found a
father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry and Harry talked to the old hermit for an
hour and more. They found him peculiar in his
ideas, but with a warm heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before they retired for the night Daniel Brown
came to the conclusion to give up his dwelling on
the top of the mountain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said he would build a cabin down by the
lakeside and there he and Blumpo could live like
ordinary people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have several thousand dollars saved up,” he
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>
said, “so we will not want for anything. I will
buy a boat, and Blumpo can make a living by
letting her out to pleasure parties.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dat will suit me exactly,” cried Blumpo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you must also go to school in the winter,”
went on Daniel Brown. “And you must
drop that dialect, and not say dat for that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Golly! but won’t I be eddicate!” murmured
Blumpo. “Say, Pop maybe I kin hab—I mean
have—a new suit, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two of them, Abraham,” said the hermit;
and then all hands laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was well for the boys that they were housed in
the hermit’s dwelling, for that night a terrible
thunder storm came up. The wind howled and
shrieked around the mountain top, and continued
until dawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we had been on the plateau we would have
been blown off into the lake,” said Harry, at
breakfast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By nine o’clock it cleared off and at twelve the
mountain was as dry as ever. They packed up,
and, accompanied by the hermit, set off, for the
old camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Daniel Brown knew every inch of the mountain
and under his guidance they reached the bottom
much quicker than they would otherwise have
done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they were trailing through the woods toward
the camp, Harry suddenly put up his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>
“Listen! Don’t you hear some persons talking?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where can it be?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Down by the camp,” said Blumpo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Si Peters’ crowd, I’ll bet a new hat!” cried
Jerry. “Come on, all of you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young oarsman broke into a run, and
Harry and Blumpo came after, with the hermit
lagging on behind. A turn in the brush brought
them in sight of the camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were Si Peters, Wash Crosby, and four
others in the act of shoving Harry’s craft into the
water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They intended to run off with our boat!”
yelled Jerry. “Stop, there, you thieves!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop, or we’ll fire on you!” added Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Peters crowd were surprised and alarmed.
They hesitated for a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go ahead, don’t mind them!” howled Si
Peters. “Quick, fellows, shove out to the
yacht!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before Jerry and the others could reach the spot
the big row-boat was afloat. The Peters crowd
leaped on board and quickly shipped the oars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop, or we’ll fire on you!” sang out Harry
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fire and be blowed!” howled Wash Crosby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bang! went Harry’s gun, and the shot rattled
all around the row-boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>
But now a turn of a headland took the craft out
of range.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Follow me!” said Jerry, as he leaped across
the camp to where they could again catch sight of
the craft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over the rock and through the brush they stumbled,
a distance of two hundred feet. Then the
shore of the lake was again reached.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, alas! before they could do anything the
Peters crowd was entirely out of range. They
saw the big row-boat taken over to where the
yacht lay at anchor. Harry’s craft was tied fast
to the stern and the Rockpointers clambered
aboard their own vessel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye and good luck to you!” cried Si
Peters, mockingly. “Hope you fellows enjoy
playing Robinson Crusoe. We’ll come back for
you some time next year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then the yacht sailed away, leaving those
on the island to their fate.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>AN EXCITING CHASE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>For the moment the boys did not know what to
do. Si Peters and his crowd had run off with
their row-boat, and how to get to the mainland
was a serious question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To swim the distance would be a dangerous undertaking,
and there was no telling how long it
would be before another craft should come along
to take them off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the hermit solved the problem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you want to follow those boys you can take
my boat,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you a boat?” asked Jerry, quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly, although I use it but sparingly, and
then only at night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hermit led the way to the lower end of the
island. Here in a water-cave rested a long, round-bottomed
row-boat, containing two pairs of oars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just the thing!” cried Jerry. “Come on,
Harry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He and his chum leaped in. Blumpo looked at
his newly found father.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>
“I will go along if you wish,” said the hermit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In five seconds more all four were in the boat,
which was then shoved out into the lake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With Jerry and Harry at the oars, they made
good progress in the direction of Si Peters’ yacht.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All were armed, and Blumpo occupied the time
in seeing that every weapon was ready for use.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The wind is dying out,” said Harry. “That is
in our favor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They have not more than half a mile start,”
rejoined Jerry. “We ought to catch up in half an
hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was evident that those on the yacht did not
anticipate pursuit, for it was not until the distance
between the two craft had been considerably
lessened that they showed signs of alarm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They see us!” cried Blumpo. “Shall I give ’em
a shot?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; wait,” replied Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wind had now gone down almost entirely,
and the yacht’s sails were flapping idly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Si Peters and Wash Crosby were evidently
alarmed at the turn affairs had taken, and they
called their chums around them for consultation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can’t do anything while the wind is down,”
said Crosby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s get out and row,” suggested Graves, who
was one of the number.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can we tow the yacht?”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>
“We can try.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was decided on, and all of the crowd leaped
into Harry’s boat. They brought the craft
around to the yacht’s bow, and then every one
took an oar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See, they are hauling off the yacht!” cried
Harry. “They mean to get away somehow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll race them,” replied Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They bent to their oars and made the old hermit’s
boat fairly fly through the water. Slowly
they crept nearer and nearer. It was an exciting
chase.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take my place, Blumpo!” cried Jerry, at last,
and the boy willingly obeyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry leaped into the bow, and taking up his
gun pointed it at Si Peters’ head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Si Peters!” he called out, “do you see this
gun? Unless you stop rowing I’ll fire at you, no
matter what the consequences are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Si Peters turned deadly white, for he was in
reality a big coward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you hear me?” went on Jerry. “One—two—th——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop! don’t shoot!” yelled the Rockpoint
bully, and he held up his oar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Wash Crosby, you stop rowing, too!”
went on Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Think you are boss, eh?” sneered Crosby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am. Up with the oar!”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>
Crosby hesitated, and then his oar went up beside
Si’s. The others became badly frightened and
also stopped rowing. In a moment more the hermit’s
craft was beside the big row-boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Rockpointers gazed at the white-haired man
in astonishment. They wanted to know who he
was, but just then had other matters to attend to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think you own the earth when you have a
gun!” howled Si Peters to Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re on top, that is certain,” responded our
hero. “Say, Harry, supposing we get on the
yacht and make them row us back to the island?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much!” growled Wash Crosby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just the thing!” cried Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still keeping the Peters crowd under guard,
Jerry and his friends boarded the yacht.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, much against their will, they made the
others turn about and drag them back to where
they had started from, towing the hermit’s craft
behind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peters and Crosby were in a perfect rage, but
could do nothing, as Jerry pretended to be very
savage and itching to shoot them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The island reached, Jerry made the Peters crowd
beach the boat and clean her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now take your yacht and begone!” he commanded,
and the crowd hurried off in double-quick
order. As the yacht drifted away the hermit
laughed heartily.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>
“Cleverly done!” he said. “Jerry Upton, you
are a smart lad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys spent one more day on the island and
then left for home. The hermit went along, and
created some surprise when he appeared on the
streets of Lakeview with Blumpo, his son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the boys were glad that the homeless youth
had found a father, who would endeavor to make
something out of the good-natured and honest
lad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was also a surprise for our hero and
Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Si Peters and his gang had been arrested for
burning down a barn belonging to Harry’s father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Rockpoint lads tried to beg off, but the
authorities took the matter in hand, and every
one of them was sent to the reformatory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This ended the rivalry for the time being between
Lakeview and Rockpoint and, as a consequence,
the autumn and winter which followed
were comparatively quiet. But stirring events
were on the way, as the chapters which follow will
testify.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>HARRY’S NEW YACHT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Luff up a bit, Harry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Jerry. Do you think we will make
that point?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the wind holds out. We are behind the
rocks now, and that cuts most of the breeze off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blumpo, coil up some of that rope, will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be suah,” returned the youth addressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scene was the deck of a handsome yacht
named the Whistler. She was as clean cut as a
craft could be, and carried a spread of snowy
white sails which would have gladdened the heart
of any sea-dog to behold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three boys and an old man were sailing this
craft. The three boys were Jerry, Harry and
Blumpo. The man was Jack Broxton, the boathouse
keeper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The yacht was a new one, recently purchased by
Harry Parker’s father for the use of his son and
Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you remember what a row we had up
around this island last summer with Si Peters,
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>
Wash Crosby and the rest of the Rockpoint
crowd?” mused Jerry, as the yacht swung around
the north point of Hermit Island, that spot where
Blumpo had so strangely found his father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t I, though!” cried Harry. “I wonder if
they are out of the reformatory yet for setting fire
to the barn?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard da was,” put in Blumpo, who now
attended school regularly. “Si Peters got out
las’ month, an’ Wash Crosby got out six weeks
ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I hope they turn out better boys now,’ ”
said Harry, seriously. “I don’t see why they
want to get into such trouble. A fellow can have
lots of sport without doing wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the way, Harry, the great yacht race comes
off in Long Lake in a few weeks,” said Jerry.
“Why can’t we take our yacht down through the
river and be on deck to see it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By golly, dat would be most splendiferous!”
yelled Blumpo. “De best t’ing I’ve dun heard of
dis Summah!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve thought of it,” returned Harry. He
turned to the old tar. “Jack, could we take the
Whistler down through Poplar River to Long
Lake?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon we could,” was the slow answer, as
Jack Broxton rolled his quid from one cheek to
the other. “The water is running putty high
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>
“It would be a fine trip in itself,” went on Jerry.
“I’ve never sailed down the Poplar beyond Carlville.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor I,” returned Harry. “But never mind
that just now. Here we are at the landing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An’ heah am my father’s house,” said Blumpo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The former hermit, now, however, a hermit no
longer, came out to greet his son. In the meantime
all hands lowered sail and tied up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a beautiful day, and the young oarsman
and Harry had come over to the island to see
what they could shoot. They left Jack in charge
of the yacht and Blumpo with his father, and
started off with guns and game bags for the interior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There can’t be much game at this season of the
year,” said Harry. “But we may have a little
sport, and tramping in the woods does a fellow
lots of good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed I know that,” was the quick response.
“Hullo, here’s a nasty bit of bog to cross.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll go around by yonder big tree.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two boys went on in a semi-circle. When
the big tree mentioned was reached Jerry stepped
on what he supposed was one of the twisted roots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A second later he let out a yell which was heard
down to the landing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sprang back so suddenly that he bumped
into Harry, who was close behind, and both rolled
over in the wet grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>
Ere they could rise they heard an angry hiss,
and a snake darted from the tree and settled
directly upon Jerry’s body!</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment Jerry was too paralyzed with
fear to move or speak. Then as he recovered he
threw off the snake and rolled away, over Harry
and close to the boggy spot. Harry also turned
away, but came up against a heavy mass of
brush.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The snake hissed angrily. The pressure of Jerry’s
foot on its head had just been sufficient to
arouse its anger. It meant to strike if it could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hit it with your gun!” shouted Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You hit it!” cried our hero. “Oh!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The snake was again coming on, its long, green
body quivering in the spots of sunlight which shot
under the trees. There was no doubt but what
it intended to fight the intruders. More than
likely it had a nest of young near.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bang!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shot was a square one, and when the smoke
from the gun cleared away it was found that the
reptile’s head was completely severed from the
body, which latter continued to twist about until
it fell into the water of the bog hole. Jerry
kicked the head in after it, out of sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us get out of here,” he said, with a shudder.
“Who knows but what we have dropped
into a regular nest of snakes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>
That he was right in his surmise was soon evident,
for low hissings could be heard on several
sides. Without delay they sprang across the bog
swamp and took to the higher ground, where they
could see every foot of the way before them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve had snakes enough to last me the rest of
the summer,” soliloquized Jerry. “I hate them
worse than anything else in the world. Look!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pointed on ahead, to where there was a tree
almost loaded with game birds. At a sign from
Jerry both raised their guns and fired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a flutter and a whirr, and then came
a number of shrill cries from the birds which were
wounded. These the boys at once proceeded to
put out of their misery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Four birds,” said Harry, as he counted the lot.
“That wasn’t bad, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re right, Harry. We won’t get another
such shot if we tramp all day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I move we get back to the yacht. We have
come a good distance, and it will be more than
dinner time before we can make it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am with you. We can go out hunting again
this afternoon, or try our hand at fishing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the birds in their bags, Jerry and Harry
set out on the return to the landing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the way they talked over the great yacht
races soon to come off, and also of the proposed
trip through the Poplar River to the large lake
beyond.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>
“It will be a dandy trip,” said Jerry, and then
he added, with much spirit: “How I would like
to sail on one of the yachts and help win.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So would I,” rejoined Harry. “It would be
great sport, not to say anything of the honor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the chums arrived at the boat-landing
they found Blumpo and the others waiting for
them. A camp fire was burning a short distance
away from the log house, and over this the birds
were done to a turn by the youth, while the others
prepared some potatoes and coffee brought from
the yacht.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blumpo’s father considered it a great holiday to
have his son with him for the time being. He
asked Blumpo how he was getting along with his
studies, and was pleased to learn that the youth
was making fairly good progress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After dinner it was decided to sail around to the
lower end of the island and try bass fishing, for
which the lake was famous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then we’ll come back here and stay all
night,” said Jerry to the old man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lines were soon cast off and the main-sail
and jib set, and as soon as they caught the breeze
they swung around and down the lake at a speed
of several knots an hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Somebody else out besides ourselves,” observed
Jack Broxton, as he pointed to half a dozen
sail-boats cruising around. “This year everybody
has the yachting craze.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>
“It’s great sport,” returned Harry. “By the
way,” he went on, pointing to a large yacht coming
up the lake on a long tack. “What boat is
that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is called the Arrow, I don’t know who
owns her,” was the old boatkeeper’s reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is coming over this way. Let us stand out
a little and see who is on board.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just as you say, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; I’m curious about that yacht, too,” put
in Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The course of the Whistler was altered several
points, and they left the vicinity of the island
shore. As they drew closer to the big yacht Jerry
uttered a cry of astonishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By Jinks! It can’t be possible!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s up?” asked Harry, coming to his side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are Si Peters and Wash Crosby on the
deck of that yacht. I can see them as plain as
day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our old enemies!” murmured Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Da didn’t lose no time in gittin togedder after
da got out of de ’formatory, did da,” laughed
Blumpo. “Da say de bad ones allers do stick like
glue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, maybe they’ll be first-class chaps now,”
said Jerry, who was willing to let the past be forgotten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you be too sure on that p’int, lads,” put
<span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>
in Jack Broxton. “It’s mighty hard to make
anything out of a bad egg, and Si Peters and
Wash Crosby are bad eggs if ever there were any.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dat’s so, fo’ suah,” murmured Blumpo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we won’t have any words with them,”
said Jerry. “We’ll let bygones be bygones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would like to know where they got that
yacht,” said Harry. “It can’t be possible Mr.
Peters bought it for Si. When Si went to the
reformatory he told father he intended to send his
son to a military school and cut off his allowance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe Si has promised to reform. Hullo!
they are coming this way!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry sprang up in alarm, for the big yacht had
suddenly veered around several points and was
now coming head on toward them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll be run down!” shrieked Blumpo, in
terror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The young fools!” muttered Jack Broxton.
“Don’t they know anything about steering?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The big yacht is evidently one too many for
them. See, there is no one aboard but Si and
Wash. Two hands are not enough for such a
craft.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nearer and nearer the two yachts came to each
other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack Broxton did his best to steer clear of the
Arrow, but he was at a disadvantage. Soon the
<span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>
big yacht took away all the wind of the Whistler
and she lay helpless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep off!” yelled Jerry, but the cry was unheeded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bang! Crash! The Arrow struck the Whistler
on the bow, the long bowsprit ripping a hole in
the main-sail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then came a smashing of woodwork and the
Whistler began to sink.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>THE ROBBERY OF THE ROCKPOINT HOTEL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“We are lost!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heaben sabe us!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cling fast for your lives!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A dozen other cries rang out, for the force of the
collision was terrible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But all clung fast and no one was thrown into
the water, to be struck and perhaps instantly
killed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean, Si Peters?” yelled Jerry.
“You ran into us on purpose!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no time to reply nor to say more.
After the crash the two yachts drifted apart, and
with a somewhat damaged bowsprit the Arrow
went on her way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she slid by, Harry caught a glimpse of Wash
Crosby holding fast to a big red valise, which had
come near bounding overboard. He thought no
more of it at the time, but had good reason to remember
it later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What shall we do?” asked Jack Broxton.
“We’ve got a neat little hole in the side.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can we beach her on the island?” asked Harry.
<span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>
“I don’t want the Whistler to go to the bottom of
the lake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon I can manage it. Just hold that bit
of canvas over the hole.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry and our hero jumped to do as bidden,
while Jack Broxton and Blumpo undertook to
steer the yacht toward shore. The craft was becoming
so water-logged that she acted clumsily,
and they had their hands full.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We is gwine down, suah!” groaned Blumpo,
but as he spoke the keel grated on the sand, and a
moment later she swung around hard and fast,
and the danger of sinking was past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While Jack and Blumpo lowered the sails, Harry
and Jerry carried several lines ashore and tied
them to the trees in such a fashion that the yacht
could not pound herself, even if the wind came up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the sails were lowered old Jack inspected
the damage done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can patch the main-sail in an hour,” he said.
“But that hole at the bow will take three, and I
ought to have more tools than I’ve got aboard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t we patch things up sufficiently to take
her back into Lakeview?” asked Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe we can. But it would be better on account
of the wind to steer for Rockpoint. She
couldn’t stand the chop sea on the other course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right; we’ll steer for Rockpoint, and take
her over to Dan Mason’s boatyard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>
Blumpo ran down the shore of the island to tell
his father of what had happened. While he was
gone the others patched up the break at the bow
with some thin wood and a square of canvas,
tacked on, and gave all a coating of pitch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half an hour later found the Whistler bound for
Rockpoint. They had to sail along with great
care, for fear of breaking open the patched place.
Had this occurred they would all have gone to the
bottom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was growing dusk when the harbor at Rockpoint
was reached. At the dock they saw that
something unusual had happened. A crowd of
men were gathered about talking earnestly, and
pointing up the lake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whoever they were, they took a boat, I’m sure
of that,” said one man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s so,” said another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But who were they, and where did they go?”
asked a third.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, that’s for the police to find out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wondering what was up, Jack Broxton and the
three boys brought the Whistler around to the
boatyard and turned her over to Dan Mason.
The old fellow, who was a first-class man at repairing
boats of all kinds, promised to have the
craft in good trim by noon of the next day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you hear the news?” he asked, after their
business talk was at an end.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>
“What news?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About the hotel being robbed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Robbed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly. A couple of thieves got into the safe
and took a box of jewelry and four hundred dollars
in cash.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By George! dat am a loss!” ejaculated
Blumpo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The jewelry is said to be worth nearly one
thousand dollars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have they any idea who the thieves were?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, they wore handkerchiefs over their faces,
with holes cut in ’em for to see. Some thinks as
how they got away in one o’ the boats lying up
shore.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did they do the job?” questioned Jerry,
with much interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t hear any of the particklers, boys.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on up to the hotel and find out,” said
Harry. “We haven’t got to hurry home this
evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Side by side Harry and the young oarsman
walked to the Rockpoint Hotel, a large place,
now filled to overflowing with Summer boarders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They found every one around the resort talking
over the case. Presently Harry heard somebody
say that the stolen money and box of jewels had
been placed by the robbers into a large red valise
<span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span>
belonging to the proprietor of the hotel. At once
he called Jerry aside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know who committed this robbery,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Si Peters and Wash Crosby.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>THE RED VALISE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Of course Jerry was astonished at his chum’s
declaration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They had that red valise. I saw it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us make a few more inquiries before we say
anything,” replied Jerry, slowly. “It’s pretty bad
to accuse anybody of such a crime as this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They asked a number of people about the robbery,
but could gain no information which would
directly implicate Si Peters and his crony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We had better keep mum for the present,
Harry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, and let the robbers escape?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t want that to happen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two talked it over for awhile, and when they
returned home they were much troubled. But
that night word came from New York City which
mystified them greatly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A detective telegraphed he had captured two
tramps who confessed to a hotel robbery on Lake
Otasco.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span>
“That settles it,” said Harry. “We were all
wrong, and I am glad we said nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the following day they rowed over to Rockpoint
for the Whistler. They heard no more
about the hotel robbery, and the matter almost
slipped their minds. But they were destined ere
long to remember the occurrence full well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry and Harry talked matters over with their
parents and made plans to sail down the Poplar
River to Long Lake, and go to the yacht races at
once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack Broxton was to accompany them. Unfortunately
for Blumpo, his father was taken sick
and the youth had to remain behind to attend
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bright and early the next day the trip was commenced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It lasted two days and three nights, and then
they found themselves out on Long Lake, a large
and beautiful sheet of water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry and Jerry had studied up all the newspaper
reports concerning the race between the
Defender, a splendid yacht from the Poplar River,
and the Spray, a craft from up the lake, and they
knew exactly where to go in order to see the race
to the best advantage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know the captain of the Defender well,” said
Harry. “He and father are old friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe he’ll let you on his yacht then,” said
Jerry. “My, but wouldn’t that be jolly!”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>
“I won’t go without you,” said Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would like to be on that yacht myself,” said
old Jack Broxton, as they presently came in sight
of the Defender, anchored a short distance from
the starting point of the race.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll run up and I’ll hail the captain,” said
Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This suited everybody, and it was done. The
captain of the Defender was on deck seeing to it
that everything was in order for the race. He
greeted Harry with a pleasant wave of his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can we come on board and take a look
around?” asked Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but you won’t have time to waste,” was
the captain’s reply. “We’ve got to get down to
the starting point soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Whistler was run up alongside, and Harry
and Jerry leaped on board of the Defender. They
shook hands with the captain, and also with
Frank Lee, the captain’s nephew, a bright boy of
their own age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were much interested in the magnificent
yacht and all of her appointments, and laughed
greatly when Frank Lee snatched off their caps
and placed caps on them with the name of the
Defender above the peaks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you fellows belong to the crew!” cried
Frank Lee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, we’ll help you beat the Spray,” returned
Jerry, quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>
The captain overheard the remark and turned
to Harry:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you really like to remain on board during
the race?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed we would!” said Harry. “And we’ll do
duty, too, same as the rest of the crew, if you’ll
only keep us. You know both of us understand all
about a regular yacht.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you can stay. I am short one man, and
two boys ought to more than make up for him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps Jerry and Harry were not delighted?
They sent word to Jack Broxton, and then made
themselves familiar with the great yacht, the pride
of all on board.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon it was time to up anchor and make for the
starting point. Jerry and Harry worked manfully
at the ropes, and so did Frank Lee. No one is
allowed to remain idle on a racing yacht. The
least one can do is to rush to this side or that and
thus make “ballast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All ready!” came the word, and the signal was
given to start, and the Defender and the Spray
were off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently Jerry came over to the captain, who
was at the wheel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can we pass the Spray?” he asked, anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can try, Upton,” was the reply. “Can you
take the wheel for a minute. I must have a drink
of water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>
“Aye, aye, sir,” said Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How proudly he took hold of the wheel! He was
for the time being in absolute command of the Defender.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An extra breeze sprang up. They were sailing
almost side by side with the Spray. Suddenly the
Defender shot ahead. Our hero stuck to the wheel,
while Harry and Frank Lee did their full share of
work with the rest of the crew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Defender was ahead, but the race was not
yet over.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>THE MISHAP TO THE YACHT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The young oarsman was not allowed to remain
at the wheel long. Soon the captain of the Defender
came up again and took charge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see we have passed the Spray,” he said.
“That’s a good one for you, Upton. Now we
must keep ahead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After turning the wheel over to the captain,
Jerry moved forward to where Harry and Frank
Lee were standing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meanwhile the gallant yacht was cutting
the water like a razor. The breeze was stiff, and
they were running free before it. Soon the Spray
was almost out of sight behind them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This Defender is a great boat,” said Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the wind on the starboard quarter the
Defender and the Spray reached along for over a
mile at a six knots an hour gait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the wind fell off to almost a calm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is no good,” observed Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fortunes of racing,” laughed Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would like to see another stiff breeze.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span>
“We may catch more than enough before we
have finished,” put in Frank Lee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The further on the two yachts went the lighter
became the wind, and each in turn ran into “soft”
spots, when balloon top-sails hung up and down
idly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But no matter how the wind came the Defender
got along, leaving the Spray steadily behind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a triangular course, of three miles to each
side, and soon the first side was sailed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The yachts wore around the first mark float,
leaving it on the port hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baby jib top-sails had been sent down before the
rounding, and spinnaker poles were now ready for
the balloon sail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With booms well off to port, the Defender led the
way to the second stretch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sharp work was done in handling the spinnaker,
for just one minute after rounding this big balloon
was set and pulling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was clever work, but the Spray sailors did
fully as well, for they had their spinnaker on just
as fast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great Caesar!” ejaculated our hero, suddenly,
“Look!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ashore the sky grew black and ominous, foreboding
a coming squall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The weather certainly looked bad, and it turned
out worse than it looked.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>
Instead of wind, rain came on, and soon all on
board the yachts were soaked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think of that, Jerry?” asked
Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re going to catch it and no mistake,” replied
the young oarsman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All hands on board saw the coming squall and
looked at the captain for orders, but none came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The yachts, favored by a strengthening breeze,
were pushed on to meet that which was sure to
come, and half-way over on the third stretch it
came on hard and struck the Defender.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bang! slash! went the sails and the gallant
yacht swept well over on her side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again all looked to the captain, but he shook
his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Reckon he wants to see what she can stand,”
whispered Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was right. The captain, at the wheel, held
the yacht up to it, and held her true.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On and on they went, the sky growing blacker
and blacker as they proceeded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly Jerry heard a crack like a pistol shot,
and looking forward saw that the standing part
of the bridle to the jib had parted. The seizing
pulled out and away went the sheets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sail snapped and cracked loudly, and in a
second more it carried away the club on the clew
of the jib.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span>
“There she goes!” yelled somebody.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardly had he uttered these words when the
big sail split in half and hung flapping in the wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was now utterly useless to the racing yacht.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A new sail must be set at once, but in that high
wind who would bring the old sail in?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll volunteer!” cried Jerry, as he sprang forward,
and Harry and Frank Lee came close on his
heels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crew hung back for a moment, and in that
time Jerry reached the flying sail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He caught one end just as an extra heavy puff
of wind came on, and in a twinkle he was dragged
half overboard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now Harry and Frank Lee sprang to the
rescue, and then the regular crew came forward.
All worked like beavers, and soon the torn sail
was taken off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Six minutes later a new sail was in place, and
on went the gallant Defender as speedily as before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She carried herself well, and nothing was lost in
that blow but the jib.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meanwhile the Spray could not stand the
strain and ran on behind with all sails reefed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A great yacht,” said those on the other boats.
And the Defender stock went away up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The captain praised Jerry for the quickness with
which he had taken hold of the torn sail and
steadied it.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>
“A loose sail on board a racing craft is a dangerous
thing,” he said, “for there is no telling how
much damage it will do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The squall was of short duration, not lasting
over seven minutes, if as long. It gathered
strength as it worked off shore, and some of the
pleasure boats received the full benefit of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the Defender got within two miles of the finishing
line the breeze fell off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still the gallant craft held her own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The finish is in sight!” cried Jerry, presently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was right. A mile more and the race would
be over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those on board of the Spray did their best to
haul up to the Defender.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The effort did not avail them, for the Defender
gained steadily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last the line was crossed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Defender had won the race by a lead of over
half a mile, and she received a rousing reception.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Steam whistles blew their mightiest, flags waved,
and the crowd on the other boats shouted themselves
hoarse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a great day, and one never to be forgotten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That settles it,” said Harry. “The Defender is
the champion yacht of the club.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not long after this that the Whistler ran
up and took Jerry and Harry on board. Old Jack
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>
Broxton had seen the race and was greatly
pleased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys resolved to anchor the Whistler off the
upper shore of Long Lake that night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll leave Jack in charge and take a trip
down to Harmony Beach,” suggested Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This suited Jerry, and by half past six the two
boys were on board the open cars on their way to
the great Summer resort. They enjoyed the ride
very much, especially Jerry who had never been to
the beach before. They visited the hotels and had
supper, and then listened to a band concert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was after eleven o’clock before they were
ready to return to the Whistler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they were making their way back to the cars
Jerry caught Harry by the arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look! Look!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry looked, and in a crowd of people saw
Wash Crosby. Not far away stood Si Peters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both were swaggering around as if they had
plenty of money and wanted everybody to know
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What shall we do?” asked Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hardly know,” replied Jerry. “I feel certain
in my mind that they robbed the Rockpoint Hotel
in spite of what the detectives think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I. But we can’t prove it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two boys resolved to watch Peters and
Crosby and try to overhear any private talk they
might have.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>
Peters and Crosby entered a large music hall and
sat down at one of the tables.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Motioning to Harry, our hero led the way to the
side of the building.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A board was off, and by standing near the
opening they could hear everything Si Peters and
Wash Crosby said.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXI.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>WORDS AND BLOWS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The very first words spoken by Si Peters confirmed
the young oarsman’s suspicions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you do with the valise, Wash?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Left it on the yacht at the cove,” replied Wash
Crosby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s where you made a big mistake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How so?” growled the toady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They might take it into their heads to search
the yacht.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I guess not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We don’t want to run any chances of being
found out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re all right; don’t worry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps we are and perhaps we are not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, keep still, and let us enjoy the music,”
growled Crosby, for an orchestra was now
playing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A waiter came up and Si Peters gave an order.
Jerry was quite sure he had ordered something
stronger than what he was in the habit of drinking
at home. It was evident that the bully of Rockpoint
had turned out even worse than before.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>
“What shall we do?” whispered Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We ought to inform the police.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just my idea of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know if there are any officers around
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, there must be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They looked around, but in the darkness no policeman
could be seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You stay here and I’ll go hunt up somebody,”
said Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scarcely had he spoken, however, when their attention
was attracted to a row that was taking
place in the concert hall. Two men were fighting,
and presently a chair flew through the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At once those sitting around tried to retire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peters and Crosby rushed out in the crowd, and
not to lose sight of the pair Jerry and Harry went
after them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fifty feet from the concert hall the four came
face to face. Si Peters started back, and Wash
Crosby wanted to run for it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who—what?” stammered Peters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have caught you,” said Jerry, boldly.
“You may as well give in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We know that you robbed the Rockpoint
Hotel,” said Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not so,” cried Crosby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shut up!” hissed Si Peters.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span>
Without warning he hit Jerry a sharp blow in
the face. Then he rushed at Harry and tripped
him up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on!” he yelled to Crosby. “We must get
away!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like a deer he ran off, behind a large roller
coaster where all was dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry stopped Peters, but only for a moment.
Heavy blows were exchanged and then Peters followed
his chum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are gone, sure enough!” cried Harry, in
dismay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And gone they were, swallowed up in the crowd
which surged on all sides of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry and Harry searched in vain for the two
evil-doers and then hunted up the police and told
their story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A watch was set, but Si Peters and Wash Crosby
managed to escape from the beach resort without
being detected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry and Harry returned to Lakeview with the
Whistler, and the report spread that Si Peters
and Wash Crosby had robbed the hotel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first Mr. Peters refused to believe it. He
came over to Jerry’s home, and threatened Mr.
Upton with a lawsuit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the farmer quickly silenced him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t say a word to me, Mr. Peters,” he said.
“A boy that will try to tar and feather another
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>
boy, and then set fire to a barn and burn up
cattle, isn’t none too good to rob a hotel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My son is as good as yours!” growled Mr.
Peters, and went off in a perfect rage. But he
bothered the Uptons no more, nor did he go near
the Parkers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lake was searched, and the yacht found up
at the cove Si Peters had mentioned. On board
was found the valise taken from the hotel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this detectives were sent out to find the
two young rascals. But Si Peters and Wash
Crosby kept out of sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet the day of reckoning was not far off, as we
shall soon see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About a week after this Harry invited Jerry to
a drive along the west shore of Lake Otasco.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they bowled along they talked over all sorts
of matters, and presently Harry mentioned Si
Peters and Wash Crosby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if they are still hanging around
Harmony Beach?” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t think they would dare,” replied
Jerry. “They must know by the newspapers that
the detectives are on their track.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish we could bring them to justice. It
would be a feather in our cap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it would, Harry. But I would rather have
the law do the work. I never want to have anymore
to do with either of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span>
It did not take the two boys long to drive to the
lower end of the lake. Here the team was put up
at a livery stable, and the chums hired bathing
suits and houses, and spread themselves for a fine
dip in the lake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The water was just right, and they enjoyed
every second of the half hour they allowed themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was eight o’clock in the evening before they
went to get their team again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moon was just coming up over the rim of
the lake and this promised them a splendid drive
back to Lakeview.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Harry and our hero entered the turnout
two figures stole up from the back of the
barn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pair were Si Peters and Wash Crosby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They ran on ahead, and as the boys waited to
settle with the livery stable keeper they soon disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry drove, and the young oarsman leaned
back and took it easy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A mile was covered, and they were just passing a
clump of bushes when whizz! a stone came flying
into the carriage. It struck Jerry on the arm,
causing him to cry with pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who threw that?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whizz! came another stone. It struck Harry
in the cheek, drawing blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span>
“Whoa!” yelled Jerry, and while the horses were
still in motion, he leaped to the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had noted the direction from which the
missiles came, and bound off, but behind the
bushes all was dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look out for yourself!” cried Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was busy with the horses, who were shying
first to one side and then to the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first Jerry could see nothing, but soon he discovered
two forms in the semi-darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rushed over and found himself face to face
with Si Peters and Wash Crosby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peters!” he ejaculated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scarcely had he spoken when a club was raised.
Jerry tried to avoid the descending blow, but was
only partly successful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The club landed over his shoulder and neck and
he was more than half stunned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come!” he heard Peters whisper to Crosby,
and then all became a confused whirl and he
pitched forward in the grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two rascals ran out into the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That for you, Harry Parker!” yelled Si
Peters, and struck Harry in the knee with the
club.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime Wash Crosby sprang half into
the carriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made a grab at Harry’s gold watch chain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chain broke from the buttonhole and along
with it came Harry’s beautiful timepiece.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span>
“I’ll keep this to remember you by!” cried
Wash Crosby in derision, and away he sped across
the highway and down a side road, with Si Peters
at his heels.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>ANOTHER BOAT RACE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The horses now demanded all of Harry’s attention.
One of them was bound to run away,
and the youth had all he could do to hold the
animal in check. But the lad knew what he was
doing and presently held them under complete
control.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then our hero staggered out of the bushes with
his hand on his neck, where a big lump was
rising.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gone! Did they rob you, Jerry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you are in luck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean, Harry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Crosby took my gold watch and chain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He did. Jerry, those two chaps have turned
nothing but common thieves,” went on Harry,
bitterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It certainly looks so, Harry. What shall we
do now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span>
“Jump in and we’ll go after them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry was soon beside Harry, and they turned
up the side road taken by the fugitives. The
moon was out full, making the way as light as
day, yet nothing was to be seen of the rascally
pair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was not to be wondered at, for after running
along the road but a few hundred feet, Si
Peters and Wash Crosby had taken to an open
field. Crossing this, they came out upon a railroad
track. A freight train was coming along
slowly, around the bend of the lake, and they had
small trouble in boarding this. Inside of an
hour they were many miles away from the vicinity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry and Harry searched for the pair until midnight,
and then gave up the hunt and returned to
Lakeview. Once again the authorities were notified,
and the detectives started on a fresh hunt for
the evil-doers. Yet it was destined to be a long
time before Si Peters and Wash Crosby were heard
of again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About this time the Lakeview boat club was
organizing another series of rowing races, and
both Harry and Jerry were easily persuaded to
enter a contest, which was to take place between a
number of local oarsmen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A prize of a fine bicycle had been put up, also
several other articles of more or less value, and
<span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>
Jerry and Harry immediately went into training,
with a firm determination to win.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were seven entries, all by young fellows of
Jerry’s age, and as the youth looked at his opponents
he felt that the race would be no easy one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Saturday afternoon, the time appointed for the
contest, came, bright and clear, and it found the
lake front crowded to its utmost capacity. Many
came over from Rockpoint, but it was noticed that
those who had belonged to Si Peters’ crowd were
absent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The race was to be two miles long, up the lake
and back again. The boats were all drawn up in
a line, and everything was made ready for a start.
Jerry was at one end of the line, with Harry at
the other, and the remaining five contestants between
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bang! went the gun on the judges’ boat, and
away shot the seven rowers like one man; and the
race was begun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For over half a mile the seven contestants kept
almost side by side. Then three of them were
seen to drop behind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gravling is ahead!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Harry Parker is second.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Phil Raymond is a close third!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jerry Upton is crawling up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the shouting went on, as the four leaders
swept past. When the turning point was reached,
<span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span>
Harry led, Raymond came second, Gravling third,
and Jerry fourth. The remaining three felt they
were out of the race, and rowed back to the boathouse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good for you, Harry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter, Jerry? You’re not doing
as good as the day you beat Si Peters!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurry up, Gravling!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pull for all you know how, Raymond!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On and on came the four, their long blades
flashing brightly in the sunshine. They were making
fast time, and, no matter who won, the lake
record was likely to be broken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half way down the homestretch, Harry still led,
with Gravling but half a length behind him. A
length further back came Raymond and Jerry,
side by side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the terrific speed was now beginning to tell
upon Raymond, and slowly but surely he fell behind,
despite the urgings of his friends. Then
Jerry set to work to overtake Gravling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See Jerry Upton crawling up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but isn’t that a beautiful stroke!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gravling can’t shake him off!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are a tie!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last cry was true. When still a dozen
lengths from the finish Jerry had overtaken Gravling.
But they did not remain tied long. Half a
dozen strokes and Jerry shot ahead and the bow
of his craft overlapped Harry’s stern.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span>
“Jerry Upton is second!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s going to shake up Harry Parker for first
place!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On came the two friends, but now it was noticed
that Jerry, although he still rowed his best, seemed
to be losing his interest in the race.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will be no fun to beat Harry,” was the
thought which ran through his head; and then,
with a yell from three thousand throats, Harry
crossed the line a winner, with our hero not quite
half a boat length behind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurrah for Harry Parker!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurrah for Jerry Upton!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cheer after cheer rent the air, and both lads were
immediately surrounded by their friends. Jerry
was one of the first to shake his chum’s hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won it fairly, Harry,” he said. “What
kind of time did we make?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was greatly pleased to learn that the lake
record for two miles had been lowered by forty-three
seconds, and that he had helped lower it by
forty-two seconds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening the club held a meeting, and Harry
was presented with the bicycle, something he had
been wishing for for some time. Jerry’s prize was
a silver watch and chain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This just suits me,” he said. “Now, when I’m
away from home, I’ll be able to tell what time it
is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span>
The celebration was at its height, when a message
came for Jerry from his home, stating that
his father had been kicked by one of the horses
and was badly injured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This news shocked the youth a good deal, and
bidding his friends a hasty good-night, the young
oarsman set off for the farm on a run.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found his father lying on a couch in the dining-room.
A doctor had just arrived, and he was
doing all that he could for the sufferer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where did the horse kick him, mother?” he
questioned, hurriedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the side, right under the heart,” replied Mrs.
Upton. “Oh, I do trust it is not serious!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I. What can I do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. We must see what the doctor
says.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The medical man, after a long examination, declared
that several ribs had been fractured, and
that Mr. Upton was suffering from shock. Some
medicine was administered, and the patient was
carefully carried upstairs and placed upon a
bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one in the farmhouse slept that night. Mrs.
Upton sat by her husband’s side, and Jerry came
and went, ready to do anything that might be
asked of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two days later the doctor pronounced the
wounded man out of danger. But his injuries
<span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>
were severe, and it would be a long while before
Mr. Upton would be able to go around as before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His enforced idleness made the farmer fret a
good deal. It was true that the harvest work on
the farm was over, but he had wished to do much
more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I reckon that trip to New York is now
out of the question,” Jerry heard him say to Mrs.
Upton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, father, were you going to New York?”
asked the boy, in much curiosity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had an idea that way, son,” returned Mr.
Upton, slowly. “I was going on business,” he
added, after a pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this Jerry was more curious than ever.
New York was over two hundred miles from Lakeview,
and he had never heard of his parent having
business in the metropolis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see it’s this way, Jerry,” said Mr. Upton,
noticing his look. “When your uncle Charley
died he left all his property to me. Some time
ago I was cleaning out one of his old trunks and
I ran across some deeds to property in California.
From what I can make out the land must be nigh
to the city of Sacramento.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the property belongs to you?” cried
Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I can’t say that exactly. As near as I can
figure it, your uncle Charley owned an interest in
<span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>
it. The property was in the hands of a land
boomer named Alexander Slocum, and there was
a letter in the trunk from this Alexander Slocum
which was dated from New York. I think this
boomer holds other papers relating to the land,
and I was thinking of making a trip to New York
and hunting him up, if he is still there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not let me go to New York in your place,”
suggested Jerry, quickly. It had always been the
ambition of his life to pay a visit to the great
metropolis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I was kind of thinking of that, son,”
returned the sick man, slowly. “I’ll see about it
in a day or two.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>JERRY STARTS ON A JOURNEY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now that the matter had once been talked over,
the young oarsman was very anxious to know all
about the property in California, and his mother
brought forth the deeds and other papers found
in the old trunk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy studied the documents with care. He
knew but little of the law, yet he felt that if the
land mentioned in the papers was valuable his
father’s share, as heir to his uncle, must be considerable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would like to ask Mr. Parker about this,” he
said to his folks, but Mr. Upton shook his head.
He was a very retired man and never brought his
affairs to the ears of any outsider.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The whole thing might prove worthless,” he
said, “and then we would be laughed at by our
neighbors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d risk it,” said Jerry, but his father only
shook his head again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless Mr. Upton appeared to be favorably
impressed with the idea of Jerry’s going to
New York to hunt up Alexander Slocum.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span>
“It won’t do any harm,” he said to his wife. “I
have money for the fare in the house, and it will
give Jerry a chance to see a bit of the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Upton was doubtful, but when Jerry begged
to go she finally consented. Long talks about the
western land and Alexander Slocum followed, and
the youth prevailed upon his folks to let him take
the deeds and papers with him, promising that he
would take the best of care of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And while I’m in New York I’m going to look
around for a situation, and earn a little money,”
said Jerry. “Who knows but what I may strike
even a better opening than that Mr. Parker has
promised me at his shoe factory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not likely a lad off the farm can strike
much,” smiled his mother, yet she was pleased at
Jerry’s earnestness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three days later Jerry was off, valise in hand.
He had bid good-bye to Harry and Blumpo, telling
them he was going to New York on some private
business for his father. His mother saw him
to the train and kissed him affectionately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take good care of yourself, Jerry,” she said.
“And remember, New York is an entirely different
place from Lakeview or Rockpoint, and you must
have your eyes and ears open to avoid trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take care of myself, don’t worry mother,”
and two minutes later the train came along and
he was off.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span>
Yet it must be confessed that our hero felt just a
bit strange as he settled back in the cushioned
seat, with his valise beside him. He was going
over two hundred miles from home and among
total strangers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose it will be different from knocking
around Lakeview, Rockpoint or even Long Lake,”
he mused. “I’ll have to brace up and watch myself,
or they’ll take me for a regular greeny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the train moved on, Jerry revolved the situation
in his mind. He knew he would arrive in the
metropolis late in the afternoon, and determined
to seek a boarding-house first of all, knowing it
would be useless to hunt for any trace of Alexander
Slocum after office hours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last the run through green fields and small
towns and cities came to an end, and the train ran
into the Grand Central Depot at Forty-second
Street, and Jerry alighted in a crowd and made his
way to the street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cab! coupe! This way for the Central Hotel!
Evening paper! Sun or World!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A hundred cries seemed to start up all in an
instant, making Jerry’s ears ring. The rattle of
the carts and trucks on the pavement was also
new, and for the moment, the Lakeview boy did
not know which way to turn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Carry yer baggage?” queried a bare-foot boy,
and almost caught his valise from his hand. But
<span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span>
the young oarsman pulled it back and shook his
head, and got out of the crowd as quickly as he
could, starting eastward, for he had heard that
the cheaper boarding houses lay in that direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not long before the boy came to several
places which displayed the sign, Boarding. But
the first two were too elegant, and Jerry passed
them without stopping. Then came a third, and
ascending the steps Jerry rang the bell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An elderly lady answered the summons, a sharp-faced
woman with powdered hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You take boarders here?” queried Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We do, young man,” she answered, in a voice
that made our hero far from comfortable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect to stay in New York a week or two,
and I—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We don’t take transients,” she snapped.
“Only regular boarders with first-class references,”
and she shut the door in Jerry’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was glad enough to escape to the pavement,
feeling satisfied that he would not have cared to
have boarded there, even had she been willing to
take him in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A block further on was another place, a modest
brick residence, set back behind a small plot of
green. Thinking this looked inviting, and not
reasoning that the spot of green was as valuable
as a brown-stone building would have been,
Jerry entered the garden and made known his
<span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span>
wants to the servant who was dusting the piazza
chairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She called the lady of the house, who on hearing
what Jerry had to say, smiled in a motherly way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hardly think I can take you in, my boy,” she
said. “Do you know how much I charge a week?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twelve to fifteen dollars for a single room and
not less than ten otherwise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry almost gasped for breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is twice what I can afford to pay,” he
returned. “Gracious! I had no idea rates were so
high.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is not high, here in New York. But perhaps
I can direct you to a place that will suit. I
have a friend three blocks over. Here is her card,”
and she handed it over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thanking her, the young oarsman got out without
delay. He was glad she had directed him, for
now he was certain he would at least strike a place
that would fit his pocket-book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry went on until he came to an avenue down
which the elevated cars were running. They were
a great novelty and he paused on the corner to
watch several of the trains rattle along overhead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Jerry was about to move on, he heard a wild
cry of alarm from the second story window of a
house opposite. Looking in the direction, he saw
a girl pointing up the street to where a baby-carriage
<span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span>
had rolled from the pavement to the
gutter, overturning itself and spilling a little child
into the street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The youth ran in the direction with the idea of
picking the child up. As he did this an ice-wagon
came along at a furious speed, the driver on the
seat trying in vain to stop his horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ice-wagon was heading directly for the child
and unless something was done the little one
would be run over and most likely killed. With
his heart in his throat our hero threw down his
valise and leaped to the rescue. In another instant
the runaway horse was fairly on top of the
lad.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>THE WORK OF A REAL HERO.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry’s heart was in his throat when he sprang
to the rescue of the little child in the street. He
saw that the horse attached to the ice-wagon
could not be stopped and realized only too well
what it meant should he be struck down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet the sight of that innocent face nerved him
on, and in less time than it takes to write it he
had the child in his arms. Clinging to the little
one, he flung himself backward, and like a flash
the horse sprang past, dragging the ice-wagon
so close that the wheels scraped his leg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A shout went up from the crowd, but Jerry did
not hear what was said. Staggering up, he ran
back to the sidewalk, leaving the baby-carriage
a wreck behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In another moment the girl who had given the
first cry of alarm was at Jerry’s side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he hurt? Is little Tommy hurt?” she cried,
as she snatched the youngster from Jerry’s arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me fell in the dirt,” lisped the little one. “Me
ain’t hurt, but me awful dirty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind the dirt, dear,” cried the girl. “I
<span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span>
am thankful you escaped. Mary, why didn’t you
take better care of him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last words were addressed to an Irish girl
who had just sauntered up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I went to get a hoky-poky at the corner,” replied
the girl. “I don’t care to mind yer brother
any more anyway,” she added, and darted out of
sight into the crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seeing the little boy was uninjured, the crowd
moved on, and presently the young oarsman found
himself alone with the girl, who appeared to be
several years older than himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a brave boy,” she said, warmly. “I
would like to reward you, but I am poor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want any reward,” replied Jerry,
stoutly. “It was a close shave, though.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look like a stranger around here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am—I just arrived in New York and I am
looking for a boarding-house. Can you tell me
where this one is?” and Jerry showed her the card
the lady had given him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes; it is one block over to your left—a
real nice house, too. May I ask your name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jerry Upton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mine is Nellie Ardell, and this is my brother
Tommy. We are alone here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t you any folks?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Mother was with us up to last winter, but
she had consumption and died.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>
The tears stood in Nellie Ardell’s eyes as she
spoke. Jerry saw at once that she had had a hard
struggle of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you do for a living?” he ventured to
ask.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do sewing and mending for my neighbors—principally
mending for the girls who work in the
stores.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And can you make much that way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a great deal. But I try to make enough
to pay the rent and store bills. May I ask what
you are going to do in New York?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I came to find a real estate dealer named Alexander
Slocum. I want to see him about some
property left by my uncle to my father. Have you
ever heard of him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heard of him?” she cried in surprise. “He is
my landlord.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry was dumbfounded by this unexpected bit of
information.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are certain?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, of course I am. He was around to see
me only day before yesterday about the rent. I
am a bit behind, and I had to put him off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what kind of a man is he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think he is very hard-hearted. But then,
that may be because I am behind in my payment.
He threatened to put me out of my rooms if I
didn’t pay when he called again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span>
“How many rooms have you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only two, and I pay six dollars a month for
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how far behind are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I only owe for the month.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he won’t trust you even that long? He
certainly must be mean,” Jerry rejoined warmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said something about property belonging
to your father,” said Nellie Ardell. “Has Mr.
Slocum an interest in it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has and he hasn’t,” the boy replied, and he
told his story in a few words as they walked along
to the entrance of the house in which she lived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I trust you get your right, Jerry Upton,”
said the girl. “Come and see me some time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will,” and after Jerry had procured Alexander
Slocum’s office address from her, the pair
separated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry was very thoughtful as he proceeded on
his way. By a turn of fortune he had gotten on
Slocum’s track much quicker than expected. The
question was, how should he best approach the
man?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll settle that after I have procured a boarding
place,” he thought, and hurried to the address
given him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Price, the landlady, was a very nice old
person. She had a top room in the back she said
she would let with board, for five dollars a week,
<span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>
and Jerry closed with her without delay, paying
for one week in advance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This finished, our hero found he was hungry,
and after a washing-up, ate supper with a relish.
He could not help but notice that the vegetables
and milk served were not as fresh as those at
home, but remembered he was now in the city and
not on a farm, and did not complain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Price had taken in another new boarder
that day, a tall, slim man, possibly thirty years
of age. He was introduced as Mr. Wakefield
Smith, and he did all he could to make himself
popular. Jerry felt that a good bit of his pleasantry
was forced, but as there was no use in finding
fault, he became quite friendly with the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Supposing we take a walk out together this
evening?” Wakefield Smith suggested. “No
doubt you would like to see the sights.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go out for an hour or so,” answered the
young oarsman, and they started while it was yet
light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Wakefield Smith knew the metropolis from
end to end, and as the pair covered block after
block, he pointed out various buildings. He
smoked constantly, and several times invited
Jerry to have a cigar, but the youth declined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Supposing we have a drink, then?” he urged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Jerry declined, which made the man
frown. He insisted Jerry should at least have
<span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span>
some soda water with him, and at last the boy
accepted, and they entered rather a modest looking
drug store on a side street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo! what’s that crowd on the street?” exclaimed
Mr. Wakefield Smith, as the glasses were
set out, and as Jerry looked out of the doorway
he fancied the man shoved up close to where his
glass was standing and made a movement as if to
throw something into it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry saw nothing unusual in the street, and the
man’s manner made him suspicious, so that he
hesitated about drinking the soda. He swallowed
a small portion of it and threw the remainder in a
corner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter, don’t you like it?” demanded
Wakefield Smith, almost roughly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it’s bitter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Humph!” He growled something under his
breath. “I’ll not treat you again,” he went on, as
they came out on the street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What Jerry had taken of the soda had made his
head ache, and this caused the young oarsman to
grow more suspicious than ever. He had read in
a daily paper about folks being drugged by friendly
strangers, and resolved to be on guard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pair passed on the distance of a block, and
then Jerry announced his intention of returning
home to the boarding-house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, don’t go yet,” urged Mr. Wakefield Smith.
<span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span>
“Come on across the way. There are some beautiful
pictures in an art store window I want to
show you. One of the pictures is worth ten thousand
dollars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He caught our hero by the arm and hurried him
over the way and into the crowd. Jerry was
jostled to the right and left, and it was fully a
minute before he squeezed himself out to a clear
spot. Then he looked around for Mr. Wakefield
Smith, but the man was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like a flash Jerry felt something had gone
wrong. He put his hand in his pocket. His
money was missing!</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXV.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>A FRUITLESS SEARCH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Less than half a day in New York and robbed!
Oh, what a greeny I have been!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus Jerry groaned to himself as he searched
first one pocket and then another. It was all to
no purpose, the money was gone and he was left
absolutely penniless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young oarsman was certain that Mr. Wakefield
Smith had robbed him. He had been wary of
the man from the start, and now blamed himself
greatly for having given the rascal the chance to
take the pocket-book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without loss of time Jerry darted into the
crowd again, looking in every direction for the
thief. He was so eager, he ran plump into an old
gentleman, knocking his silk hat to the pavement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hi! hi! stop, you young rascal!” puffed the
man, as Jerry stooped and restored the tile to
him. “What do you mean by running into me in
this fashion?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excuse me, but I have been robbed! I want to
catch the thief.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Robbed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='154' id='Page_154'></span>
“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gentleman nervously felt to see if his money
and watch were safe. Several others heard the
words, and they gathered around Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who robbed you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much did you have?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why didn’t you hold the thief?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before Jerry could answer any of the questions
a policeman came forward and touched him on
the shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you the boy said he was robbed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What were you robbed of?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A pocket-book containing nearly thirty dollars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you see the thief?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe it was a man I was walking with. He
called himself Wakefield Smith.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The policeman questioned Jerry closely, and
then took a good look around for the individual.
Later on, boy and officer walked to Mrs. Price’s
boarding-house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here it was learned that Mr. Wakefield Smith
had not paid any board money, giving as an
excuse that he had nothing less than a one-hundred-dollar
bill and that he would pay in the
morning. It also came to light that he had walked
out with Mrs. Price’s silver-handled umbrella,
worth eight dollars.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span>
“The villain!” she cried. “I hope the police
catch him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t wish it more than I do,” returned
the young oarsman, dolefully. “He took my last
dollar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Acting on the policeman’s advice, Jerry walked
around to the nearest precinct station and made
a complaint, giving the best description of Mr.
Wakefield Smith he could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will do our best to capture him,” said the
captain in charge, and with this promise the
youth had to be content.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My readers can imagine our hero did not spend
a restful night. He lay awake for several hours
speculating on the turn affairs had taken. His
board was paid for a week, but that was all. He
did not even have money to pay car fare back to
Lakeview.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder what mother and father would say
if they knew?” he thought. “I won’t let them
know until there’s nothing else to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry arose early the next day and got breakfast
before any of the other boarders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must find something to do without delay,”
he explained to Mrs. Price. “A fellow without a
dollar in his pocket can’t afford to remain idle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have a week’s board coming to you,” she
said, with a faint smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but I haven’t even the price of a car fare
in my pocket.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span>
“Well, Mr. Upton, I like your looks, and if
you’ll accept it I’ll loan you a couple of dollars.
I suppose it was partly my fault that Smith robbed
you. But don’t blame me, I’ve suffered, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will accept the loan gladly, Mrs. Price. I
don’t like to go around without a cent. I will
pay you back as soon as I can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know you will. I may have been deceived in
that Smith, but I am certain I am not in you,”
added the landlady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the two dollars tucked away in a safe
place, Jerry left the house. He knew it would be
useless to go to Alexander Slocum’s office at such
an early hour, and determined to look around in
the hope of striking something whereby he might
earn at least enough money to last him while
stopping in New York.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t write home unless I have to,” he muttered
to himself. “My time is my own and I’ll
make the most of it while I’m here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Getting one of the dollar bills changed, Jerry
bought a morning paper and looked over the
Help Wanted—Males—column, and noted several
addresses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll try them and lose no time,” he thought,
and hurried to the nearest store where a boy was
wanted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was surprised to find a dozen applicants
ahead of him. Worse than that, a boy had already
<span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'></span>
been hired; so all of the others were forced
to leave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry next tried a florist’s establishment. But
here a boy was wanted who understood the city
thoroughly, and he was quickly told he would not
do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry walked from one place to another for three
hours without success. Somewhat disheartened,
he strolled into a park close to Broadway and sat
down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The situation was certainly a serious one, and
the young oarsman was decidedly sober in mind
as he sat there, staring vacantly at the hurrying
throng.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, young man, how did you make out last
night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The question came from a bench just behind
Jerry. Looking around, he saw sitting there the
gentleman he had run into while trying to find
Wakefield Smith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t make out at all, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Couldn’t find him, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those pickpockets are slick chaps, and no mistake,”
went on the gentleman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you lose much?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All I had—nearly thirty dollars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Phew! that is too bad. Well, I wouldn’t sit
down to mope about it. You might as well get
to work and earn the amount over again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span>
“The trouble is, I can’t find any work,” answered
the boy, earnestly. “I would work fast enough
if I could only find it to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are out of a situation?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since when?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since I came to New York,” answered Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are about as bad off as I was some forty
years ago,” said the man, with a broad smile.
“At that time I found myself in this city, with
just twenty-five cents in my pocket. But I struck
employment, and rose from one place to another
until now I am my own master, with a
book-binding-shop where I employ nearly fifty
hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he spoke he gazed at Jerry curiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were going to ask me for a job, weren’t
you?” he went on, and Jerry nodded. “What
can you do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not used to any such work, sir. But you’ll
find me willing and strong—and honest. I would
like to earn a little before I went back to my
home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, those three qualities you mention are
sure to win, my boy. Perhaps I can find an opening
for you. Here comes a friend I have been
waiting for. I am going out of town with him.
Call at my shop to-morrow morning, if you don’t
strike anything in the meantime.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span>
And, handing out his card, Mr. Islen walked
rapidly away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fifteen minutes later found Jerry on the way to
Alexander Slocum’s office. In an inner pocket he
carried the papers his father had unearthed from
the trunk in the garret at home.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>ALEXANDER SLOCUM IS ASTONISHED.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry felt that his mission to the real estate
man was a delicate one. What would he have to
say when he learned who the youth was and what
he had come for?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy resolved to be on guard. He might be
from the country and green, but no one should
catch him napping, as had Mr. Wakefield Smith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The distance to the address furnished by Nellie
Ardell was nearly a dozen blocks, but Jerry was
used to walking and made the journey on foot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young oarsman found Alexander Slocum’s
set of offices located on the top floor of an old-fashioned
four-story office building. There was an
elevator, however, and this Jerry used and soon
found himself in front of a ground-glass door,
which bore the sign:</p>

<div class='lgc' style=''> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'><span class='sc'>Alexander Slocum</span>,</p>
<p class='line'>Real Estate and Fire Insurance.</p>
<p class='line'>Loans Negotiated.</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>There was a hum of voices from within, but the
hum ceased as Jerry knocked.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span>
“Come in,” was the short invitation, and the
boy entered, to find a large apartment, comfortably
furnished with desks, stuffed chairs and
other things which went to show that the man he
had come to interview was doing well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near an open window sat two gentlemen dressed
in black. One was much older than the other, and
Jerry rightfully guessed that he was an office
assistant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other man was well preserved, with a waxed
mustache and piercing black eyes. He held a silk
hat in his hand, as if he had been on the point of
leaving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, young man, what can I do for you?”
questioned the office assistant, as he regarded
Jerry indifferently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I came to see Mr. Alexander Slocum,” replied
our hero.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am Mr. Slocum,” put in the other man.
“What is it you want?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I came to see you on a bit of private business,
sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Well, Mr. Casey here knows all about
my affairs; so you need have no hesitation in
speaking in front of him,” laughed the real estate
man somewhat harshly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am Jerry Upton, and I came from Lakeview.
My uncle, Charles Upton, who is now dead, was
once interested in a colonization land scheme that
you started.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='162' id='Page_162'></span>
Jerry watched Mr. Slocum narrowly as he spoke,
and saw that the man was greatly astonished.
He started back, and for an instant the assuring
look his face wore faded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jerry Upton from Lakeview,” he murmured
slowly. Then he cleared his throat. “I—I did
not expect to see you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose not, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it you want?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to find out how matters stand in regard
to the land in California. My father heard
you had gone to Europe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did go to Europe, but not to escape inquiry,”
added Slocum, hastily. “You see, that scheme
failed utterly,” he went on slowly. “Why, I lost
nearly every dollar I possessed in it. What your
uncle lost was nothing in comparison.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was to him, Mr. Slocum. To whom does
the land belong?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, it—er—it reverted to its original owners,
some mine speculators of Denver.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is the land located?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not far from the city of Sacramento.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you give me the precise location?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this Alexander Slocum glared at our hero
savagely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would do you no good to spend money on
hunting the matter up,” he answered. “That
affair was settled long ago. The money was lost,
and that is all there is to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>
“Not if I know it, Mr. Slocum. I intend to sift
the matter to the bottom. I am convinced that
all was not carried out as it should have been.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You appear to be a very foolish boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That may be your opinion, but it won’t alter
my intention. I have my uncle’s papers with me,
and, unless you will give me some particulars of
how the scheme fell through, I shall place the matter
in the hands of a lawyer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alexander Slocum winced at this, and Jerry
fancied he was hard struck. He made a movement
as if to clutch the youth by the arm, then drew
back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have your uncle’s papers?” he asked
cautiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. My father is his sole heir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should like to see them. Perhaps I spoke
hastily; but really you are mistaken in thinking
it can be of any use to bring that old deal up
again. The money was lost, and there is no
chance of getting it back again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, either you are responsible for the amount,
or else my uncle’s interest in the land still holds
good,” said Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me see the papers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Slocum made a movement as if to take
them. But Jerry drew back and shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I prefer not to let them go out of my possession.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>
“Do you mean to say you won’t trust me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can put it that way, if you wish, Mr.
Slocum.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The real estate man bit his lip. Then he made a
movement to his assistant, who at once slid behind
Jerry, towards the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you going to do?” the young oarsman
asked, in alarm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without replying, the assistant locked the door
and slipped the key into his pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t grow excited,” said Alexander Slocum,
coldly. “I want to see those papers, that’s all.
Show them to me at once!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like a flash Jerry realized he was trapped by the
enemy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>JERRY’S CLEVER ESCAPE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry saw at once that things were growing
warm. From the look on his face it was plain to
see that Alexander Slocum was in deadly earnest
when he said he wanted to see those papers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His manner made our hero feel that the papers
would not be safe in his hands. If he gave them
up he might never see them again, and without
the documents the claim on the land in California
would fall flat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you hear what I said, Upton? I want you
to let me see those papers,” Slocum went on, after
a second of intense silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean by locking that door?”
Jerry demanded of the elderly assistant, without
paying any attention to the real estate dealer’s
words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Casey made no response. Instead, he took his
stand by his employer’s side, as if awaiting further
orders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You act as if you were afraid of me,” sneered
Slocum. “I won’t hurt you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t—not if I can help it,” answered
<span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span>
Jerry. “But I want you to unlock that door. I
am not to be treated as a prisoner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I only wanted to secure us against interruption.
So many agents come up here, and they
are a regular nuisance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slocum advanced and held out his hand, as if expecting
Jerry would drop the precious papers into
it. Instead, the boy retreated and took up a position
behind a flat-top desk in the centre of the
office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this the real estate dealer grew furious behind
his well-waxed mustache. He had expected
to intimidate our hero easily, and now he was
nonplused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you going to let me see those papers?” he
fumed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; at least not now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I prefer not to answer that question.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think you have a case against me—that
you can place me in a tight hole.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if all is straight you have nothing to
fear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t preach to me, boy. All is straight. I
lost my money as well as the others did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This doesn’t look as if you had lost much,”
ventured Jerry, as he glanced about the elegant
apartment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I have made money since, in a lucky real
<span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span>
estate deal in Brooklyn. I won’t keep your
papers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want that door unlocked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slocum muttered something under his breath,
and his face grew suddenly red. Like a flash he
placed his hands on the flat desk and leaped over
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll bring you to terms, you young country
fool!” he cried, and made a clutch for Jerry’s
collar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had our hero not turned like a flash he would
have had the lad. But Jerry was on guard and
fled to the office door. Raising his foot he gave
the barrier a kick that caused it to crack heavily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t. Let me out, or I’ll kick the door
down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Casey, catch the young rascal!” cried Slocum.
“I’m going to teach him a thing or two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anxious to obey the command of the man who
held him completely under his thumb, Casey ran
forward. Seeing him coming, Jerry fled behind a
large screen. Here rested a heavy cane, and he
picked it up and brandished it over his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep back! Advance at your peril.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid to go near the young fool,” said
Casey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll fix him. Stand aside. I never yet saw
the boy that could get the best of me,” muttered
Alexander Slocum.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span>
“He may kill you, Mr. Slocum.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll risk it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Running around the desk, the real estate dealer
came for the young oarsman. As he approached,
the boy pushed the screen against him and he went
down, with the heavy object on top of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You—you villain!” he spluttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this Jerry made no answer. Taking advantage
of the time afforded him, he looked around
for some means of escaping his enemies. To remain
a moment longer in the office he felt would
be perilous in the extreme.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near the corner to which Jerry had retreated
was an open window. Glancing out of it he saw
that the roof of the next building was but six or
eight feet below the window sill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without stopping to think twice, our hero
leaped out of the window and on to the roof
below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop! stop!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both Slocum and his assistant called after
Jerry, but he paid no attention. Leaving the
vicinity of the window, he ran along the roof to
the rear. Here there was an addition to a tin-shop
underneath, and he dropped down and found
himself within twelve feet of a narrow alleyway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you coming back?” bawled Alexander
Slocum; and then, as Jerry let himself down over
the edge of the roof, he suddenly disappeared
from the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span>
Guessing he was coming down to head him off,
the youth lost no time in dropping to the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once down, it was an easy matter to gain the
street. As he came out on the pavement, Slocum
came running up all out of breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a fine boy!” he cried. “Come back to
the office, and let us talk matters over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not to-day,” answered Jerry. “I’ve had
enough of a dose for the present.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are making a mistake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t intend to put my head into the lion’s
mouth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the two were speaking Casey came up,
and, as the two appeared as if they wanted to
drag Jerry back into the building just left, the
youth retreated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alexander Slocum followed for a block, and then
gave up the chase. Seeing this, Jerry walked on
more leisurely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our hero’s visit to the real estate dealer had set
him to thinking deeply. The man’s anxiety concerning
the papers made the boy feel sure there
was more at the bottom of the land speculation
than either his parents or he had suspected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps the land was still held by this man and
was of great value. If this was so how was he to
go to work to establish his father’s claim?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pondering over the affair, the young oarsman
thought of Mr. Randolph Islen and of his kindness.
<span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span>
He resolved to tell that gentleman his story
and see what he would have to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This conclusion reached, Jerry felt in his inner
pocket to see if the precious papers were still safe.
To his horror they were gone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>SOMETHING ABOUT A TRAMP.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Gone!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cry burst involuntarily from Jerry’s lips,
and for the moment his heart seemed to stop beating.
The precious papers were missing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What had become of them? With great haste
he hunted all of his pockets, not once but a dozen
times. Then he felt in the linings, and in fact in
all places where the packet might have become
concealed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was useless; they were gone; that was all
there was to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had he dropped them in Slocum’s office, or during
his hasty flight to the alleyway?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our hero retraced his steps, with eyes bent to
the ground, in hopes that they would be found
lying on the walk. In doing this he ran into
half a dozen folks, many of whom did not take
kindly to the collision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look where you are going, boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hunting for a pin or gold dollars?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry paid no attention to the remarks. Reaching
<span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span>
the alleyway, he turned into it and continued
the search, but without success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, wot yer doin’ in here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The question was asked by a youth in the tin-shop.
He was red-headed and had a freckled face,
but not an unpleasant one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was looking for something I lost,” said the
young oarsman. “Have you seen anything in
here of a flat, white package with a black shoestring
tied around it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes, I did,” he answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And where is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A tramp had it. I saw him walk out of der
alley wid it not five minutes ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A tramp? What kind of a looking man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tall and thin, with a grizzly beard. Oh, he
was a regular bum.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where did he go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Up the street, I think. Was the bundle valuable?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed it was, to me,” replied Jerry, and hurried
off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could see nothing of any tramp, and, after
dodging around among the trucks for several
minutes, returned to the youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please describe that tramp to me, will you?”
asked Jerry, and the tinner’s boy did so, as well
as he was able.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think da call him Crazy Jim,” he concluded.
<span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span>
“He don’t come down here very often. He
belongs uptown somewhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if you ever see him again, please let me
know. My name is Jerry Upton, and here is my
address,” and our hero handed it over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, I will. My name is Jerry Martin.
Wot was in de package?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some papers belonging to my father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy wanted to question Jerry for further
particulars, but the young oarsman did not care
to say too much, and hurried off, to seek the
tramp again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening found our hero at Mrs. Price’s,
footsore and downhearted. He had seen nothing
of Crazy Jim, and it looked as if the precious
packet was gone for good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry could not help but wonder what Alexander
Slocum’s next move would be. Would the man
endeavor to hunt him out or would he write to
his father?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning, on his way to Mr. Randolph
Islen’s place of business, Jerry met Nellie Ardell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you find Mr. Slocum’s?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did; and had a very disagreeable visit,” returned
our hero.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew you would have,” she went on. “I wish
he was not my landlord.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry asked her how Tommy was, and then they
parted, and five minutes more brought our hero
to the book-bindery.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span>
Mr. Islen was not yet in, but he soon arrived,
and smiled as Jerry presented himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On hand, I see, my young friend. Well, how
did you make out? Did you obtain a position?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s rather hard. Mr. Grice!” he called out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The foreman of the book-bindery came in and
Jerry was introduced to him. Quite a chat followed,
at the end of which Jerry was hired to work
in the stock department at a salary of six dollars
a week.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The salary was not large, but it would pay his
expenses, and that was all he wished for at present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t have to write home for money,” he
thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Grice wanted Jerry to come to work immediately,
but our hero begged to speak to Mr. Islen
in private for a moment, and when they were left
alone told his story from beginning to end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rich book-binder listened with interest, and
tapped meditatively upon his desk when Jerry had
finished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is rather a strange story, Upton,” he
said. “What would you like me to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would like you to give me some advice, sir.
What had I best do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can do a number of things. What would
be the best I cannot say. You might hire a lawyer
<span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span>
to look into the case, and again you might
have this Slocum arrested for locking you in the
office. The loss of the packet complicates matters.
Did it have your name on?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you had better wait, and in the meantime
advertise for the packet, offering a reward. That
tramp may be watching for such an advertisement.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was sound advice; but Jerry had no
money, and said so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will pay for the advertisement and take it
out of your pay,” said Mr. Islen; and the notice
was written out without delay and sent off by the
office boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young oarsman now felt a trifle lighter in
heart. He reasoned that the packet would be of
no value to the tramp and that he would be glad
to surrender it in hope of a reward. He did not
remember at the time that he had written Alexander
Slocum’s name and address on the outside
wrapper; yet such was a fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Jerry entered the bindery he found several
pairs of curious eyes bent upon him from boys of
about his own age. Without delay Mr. Grice set
our hero to work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is your name?” asked one of the boys,
as soon as he had a chance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jerry Upton. What is yours?”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span>
“Dick Lenning. Say, do you know you have
got the job Grice was going to give my brother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s so. Jack was coming to work to-morrow.
It ain’t fair to take the bread out of a fellow’s
mouth like that,” growled Dick Lenning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fancy Mr. Islen gave me my position—”
Jerry ventured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! So it was the boss put you in. Well, it
ain’t fair anyway. Where do you come from—Brooklyn?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Lakeview.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never heard of it. Must be some country
village. You look like a hayseed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Dick Lenning spoke he gazed around to see
if Mr. Grice had gone. Then he added in a whisper:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have to set up the drinks for the crowd
before you can work here, see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drinks,” repeated our hero.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure; all the new hands do that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I rather think I won’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are too mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not that; I don’t drink.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a country jay, and no mistake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick Lenning leaned forward and shoved Jerry
with his elbow, at the same time putting one foot
behind the youth. He wanted to trip our hero up,
but Jerry was on guard, and, resisting him, the
<span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span>
young oarsman caused him to slip down against a
bench upon which rested a pot of book-binders’
glue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The glue tipped over and part of it went down
Lenning’s leg, causing him to yell like a wild
Indian.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>MR. WAKEFIELD SMITH AGAIN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll hammer you for that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did he do, Dick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Knocked the glue over me. You country jay,
you!” howled Dick Lenning, and, leaping up, he
bore down on Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lenning was a good deal of a bully. He was tall
and strong, and evidently he thought he could
make our hero submit to his will easily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take that!” he fairly hissed, and aimed a
blow at Jerry’s ear. The youth dodged it and
caught his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold on!” Jerry ejaculated. “I don’t want
to fight. You will only make trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not until you promise to keep quiet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll promise nothing,” stormed Lenning, and
began to struggle more excitedly than ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he soon wore himself out, when Jerry got
behind him and clasped hands over his breast.
The bully was about to call on his friends to assist
him, when a cry went up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cheese it! Grice is coming this way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span>
As if by magic the boys who had gathered
around ran off to their work, leaving the bully
and Jerry alone. Our hero released his opponent,
and, turning around, Lenning glared at him vindictively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll get even with you for this, see if I don’t,”
he muttered in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he followed his friends; and Mr. Grice came
up and took Jerry to another part of the shop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have changed my mind about letting you
work here,” he said. “I want you to get used to
the place before I put you among those other
boys.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evening found our hero a good deal worn out,
not so much by the work as by the close confinement
of the bindery. How different life in the
great metropolis was to life in the green fields of
the country!</p>

<p class='pindent'>After supper Jerry determined to take a walk
uptown, to get the outdoor exercise and also in
hope of seeing something of the tramp who had
taken the packet. He knew that looking for
the tramp in the metropolis was a good deal like
looking for a pin in a haystack, but imagined
that even that pin could be found if one looked
long and sharp enough for it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young oarsman sauntered forth toward
Broadway, and thence past the Forty-second
Street depot and up to Central Park. It was a
<span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span>
long walk, but he did not mind it; in fact, it
seemed to do him good, for it rested his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The window displays interested Jerry not a
little, and he took in everything that came along.
So the time flew quickly, until, coming to a
jeweler’s window, he saw it was after ten o’clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll have to be getting back,” he said to himself,
and was on the point of returning when he
saw that which surprised him greatly. A cab
whirled past the corner upon which he was standing,
and on the back seat he recognized Mr.
Wakefield Smith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pickpocket was alone, and ere Jerry could
stop him the cab rolled down the side street out
of hearing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our hero did not stop long to consider what
was best to do, but took to his heels and followed
the cab as best he could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cab gained a distance of nearly two blocks,
and Jerry was almost on the point of giving up,
when it came to a halt in front of what looked
like a private club-house. Wakefield Smith alighted
and paid the cabman, who went about his
business without delay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop there!” cried Jerry to the pickpocket,
as the man mounted the steps of the house. But
whether the man heard our hero or not, he paid
no attention. When Jerry reached the spot he
was standing on a low porch.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span>
“Did you hear me?” went on Jerry, and, to
prevent Smith from entering the place, our hero
caught him by the button of his coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Jerry’s surprise, the rascal offered no resistance.
Instead, he came down the steps backward,
and fell on his back on the sidewalk, his hat rolling
toward the gutter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shay, waz you do that fer?” he hiccoughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry gazed at the pickpocket in wonder. Then
the truth flashed over our hero. The man who
had robbed him was beastly intoxicated.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXX.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>AN UNLOOKED FOR ADVENTURE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>It would be hard to express Jerry’s feelings when
he found Mr. Wakefield Smith was suffering heavily
from intoxication. For the moment he could
do nothing but stare at the man as he lay helpless
on the pavement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Waz you mean, boy?” went on Smith, and he
tried in vain to get up. “Waz you knock me
down for, I demand to know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you recognize me?” said our hero sharply,
as he looked the pickpocket squarely in the face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—don’t know you from Adam, ’pon my
word.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am Jerry Upton, the boy you robbed the
other night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the words Smith straightened up for a moment
and a look of alarm crossed his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jerry Upton,” he repeated, slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. What have you done with my money?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ain’t got a dollar of your money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you haven’t, you’ve drank it up,” Jerry
ejaculated. “You ought to be ashamed of yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span>
“Zat’s all right, m’boy, all right, I assure you.
Come on and have a good time with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With great difficulty Wakefield Smith arose to
his feet and staggered towards the house he had
been on the point of entering. Jerry pulled him
back and held him. As our hero did this he saw
Smith drop a ten-dollar bill. Jerry picked it up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not going in there—you are going
with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To the nearest station-house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pickpocket gave a hiccough and a cry of
alarm that was very much like a whine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To the station-house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; come on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Smith struggled feebly to get away, but the boy
held him with ease. Overcome, the man finally
sat down on the curbstone and refused to budge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shay, let us compromise,” he mumbled. “It
was all a mistake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was no mistake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I give you ten dollars, will you call it off?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you don’t git a cent, see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with great deliberation the pickpocket
closed one bleared eye and glared at Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll see about that later,” cried our hero,
hotly, and catching the rascal by the collar the
<span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span>
youth yanked him to a standing position. “Now
come on, and no nonsense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seeing that the youth was not to be fooled with,
Wakefield Smith tried to dicker again, getting
himself badly twisted in his plea that he would
make everything all right. Jerry would not trust
him and forced him to walk along until the nearest
corner was reached. Here he suddenly made a
clutch at an electric-light pole and held fast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Help! help! help!” he cried out at the top of
his lungs. “Police!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young oarsman did not know what to make
of this appeal for assistance, for it seemed to him
that the authorities were the very people Mr.
Wakefield Smith wished to avoid. He was destined,
however to soon learn a trick that was
brand new to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pickpocket had hardly uttered his cry when
a bluecoat put into appearance and came running
to the spot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the trouble here?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shay, officer, make that young fellow go
away,” hiccoughed Mr. Wakefield Smith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is he up to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Trying to rob me, officer; reg’lar slick
Aleck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this cool assertion Jerry was dumbfounded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you’re trying to rob this gent, eh?” said
the bluecoat, turning to our hero and catching
his arm. “I reckon I came just in time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span>
“It’s a falsehood; he is the pickpocket,” rejoined
Jerry as soon as he could speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He looks like it,” said the officer, sarcastically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He didn’t rob me now, he robbed several
nights ago. I just ran across him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a slick Aleck,” went on Mr. Wakefield
Smith. “Don’t let him take my watch, officer!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No fear of that. Come along with me, young
man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I have to go I want him to go, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At these words Mr. Wakefield Smith’s face
changed color.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t go, officer; have an important engagement
at the—er—club.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is a pickpocket and I’ll prove it at the
station house,” said Jerry, warningly. “It is
your duty to make him go along. I’ll help you
carry him if it’s necessary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you’ll skip out, too, if you get the
chance,” remarked the policeman, grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you think that, handcuff me to this fellow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hang me if I don’t think you are honest, after
all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a big thief!” bawled Mr. Wakefield Smith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep quiet and come along. They can
straighten matters out at the precinct.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The officer took Mr. Wakefield Smith by the arm
<span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span>
and started to walk the prisoner away. With a
dexterous twist the intoxicated man cleared himself
and plunged down the street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bluecoat and Jerry made after him as
quickly as they could, but a drawing school in the
neighborhood had just let out, and they were detained
by the crowd. Mr. Wakefield Smith stumbled
across the street and down a side thoroughfare
that was very dark. The officer and our hero
went after him, but at the end of the second block
he was no longer to be seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you’ve let him escape,” said Jerry to the
policeman. “I have a good mind to report you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on with you!” howled the officer in return.
“I reckon it was a put up job all around. Clear
about your business or I’ll run you in for disorderly
conduct!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he made such a savage dash at the young
oarsman with his long club that our hero was
glad to retreat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He continued the hunt for the pickpocket alone,
but without avail, and, much disheartened, finally
returned to his boarding-house. He was afraid he
had seen the last of Mr. Wakefield Smith, and
was glad he had gotten at least ten dollars from
the pickpocket.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>NELLIE ARDELL’S TROUBLES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>On the following morning Jerry went to work at
the bindery as if nothing had happened. When
he went in, Dick Lenning glared at our hero and
stopped as if to speak, but changed his mind and
walked off without saying a word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the day the young oarsman became
much better acquainted with his work and began
to like it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night, on leaving the bindery by the side
entrance, which opened on a narrow lane, our hero
saw Dick Lenning and several of his friends waiting
for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He attempted to pass but Lenning put out his
foot, and had Jerry not stopped he would have
been tripped up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me pass,” said he, sharply, but instead of
complying, Lenning took a stand in front of him
and hit the youth on the shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said I’d git square,” he hissed, savagely. “If
yer ain’t afraid, stand up and fight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not afraid,” replied Jerry, and pushed him
up against the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span>
Without delay a rough-and-tumble fight ensued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give it to him, Dick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do the hayseed up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Knock him into the middle of next week!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These and a dozen other cries arose on the air,
and the crowd kept increasing until fully a hundred
spectators surrounded the pair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick Lenning had caught Jerry unfairly, but the
youth soon managed to shake him off, and, hauling
back, gave him a clean blow on the end of his
unusually long nose, which caused the blood to
spurt from that organ in a stream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s tapped Dick’s nose!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My! wasn’t that a blow, though!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The country lad is game!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wild with rage, Dick Lenning endeavored to
close in again. Jerry stopped the movement this
time by a blow on the chest which sent him staggering
back several feet into the crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter, Dick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t let him use you like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll fix him!” howled the bully, and rushed at
our hero a third time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again he hit Jerry, this time in the chin. But
our hero’s blood was now up, and, calculating
well, he struck a square blow in the left eye that
knocked the bully flat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dick is knocked out!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That country jay is a corker!”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span>
“Git up, Dick. Yer eye is turnin’ all black!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better let him go, he’s too much for you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick Lenning was slow in coming to the front.
The eye was not only black, but it was closing
rapidly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s got a stone in his fist—he don’t fight
fair,” he growled to his friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have nothing in my fist,” retorted Jerry.
“If he wants any more, I fancy I can accommodate
him, although I don’t care to fight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick Lenning was uneasy. He glanced toward
his friends and passed a signal to one of his
cronies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Police! skip!” cried the crony. “Come on,
Dick, you don’t want to git caught!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he dragged Dick Lenning away, while the
crowd scattered like magic. No policeman was in
sight, nor did any appear. It was only a ruse to
retire without acknowledging defeat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But that fight taught Dick Lenning a severe
lesson. He still remained down upon the young
oarsman, but in the future he fought shy of our
hero, knowing that Jerry would not stand his
bullying manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Saturday the shop closed down early, and,
having nothing else to do, Jerry walked down to
the newspaper office in hope of receiving some
answer to the advertisement for the missing
papers.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span>
But no answer was forthcoming, and, disappointed,
he retraced his steps and sauntered in
the direction in which Nellie Ardell and her little
brother Tommy lived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll call on them and see how she made out
about her rent,” he said to himself, and mounted
the stairs to her apartment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a murmur of voices in the kitchen.
The door was partly open and Jerry saw the girl
and her little brother standing there, confronted
by a burly man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That rent has got to be paid, that’s all there
is to it,” the man was saying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot pay to-day,” replied Nellie Ardell.
“I will try to pay Monday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It won’t do. I’ve given you notice, and if you
can’t pay, you have got to leave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this the girl burst into tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you put me on the street?” she wailed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll have to—it’s orders,” replied the burly
man doggedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whose order?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Slocum.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Slocum is a very hard-hearted man,” cried
the girl, indignantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s so,” Jerry put in as he entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Jerry Upton!” Nellie Ardell cried, when
she saw our hero. “This man wants to put me
out of my rooms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span>
“It’s a shame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who are you?” demanded the burly man.
“Do you live here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I am this young lady’s friend, however.
Did Mr. Slocum say to put her out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What shall I do if they put me on the street?”
wailed Nellie Ardell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure I don’t know. But Slocum sha’n’t put
you on the street if I can help it,” went on Jerry,
suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What will you do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much do you owe him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twelve dollars. I have four, but he won’t take
it. He wants the entire amount.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will let you have ten dollars,” said our hero,
and brought out the bill Wakefield Smith had
dropped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, won’t that be robbing you?” cried Nellie
Ardell, but her eyes glistened with pleasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind; take it and pay this man off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nellie Ardell accepted the amount without further
words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” she said, as she paid the man, “I am
going to move.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Move! What for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can get better rooms for less money just
across the way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The burly man’s face fell. He was Alexander
<span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span>
Slocum’s agent, and he knew that to get tenants
for the rooms Nellie Ardell occupied would be difficult.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It ain’t right to move now—in the middle of
the summer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You intended to put me out—if I couldn’t pay
the rent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is different.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have paid up promptly for many months.
Mr. Slocum could have been a bit easier for once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is more than mean,” put in Jerry. “I
would advise you to move by all means.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You seem to know a great deal about him,”
sneered the agent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do—and I’ll know more some day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The agent began to growl, but, seeing he could
do nothing, he went off to inform Alexander Slocum
that Nellie Ardell intended to move.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>A CRAZY MAN’S DOINGS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“You are more than kind to me, Jerry Upton,”
exclaimed Nellie Ardell, when they and her little
brother were left alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t want to see you thrown out of your
home,” said Jerry, soberly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall pay you back that money as soon as I
possibly can,” she went on. “I expect to get
about twenty dollars for sewing next week. One
of the ladies I work for is out of town, but is coming
back on Wednesday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right—take your time. When will you
move? Maybe I can help carry some things for
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve a good mind to move this afternoon.
Those other rooms are all ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then do it, and I’ll pitch right in,” and in fun
the young oarsman picked up several chairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will. Will you be kind enough to stay with
Tommy a few minutes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nellie Ardell went off at once, and was back in
ten minutes. When she returned she had rented
<span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span>
three small rooms for less money than she now
paid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had not many articles of furniture and it
did not seem the least bit like working to our hero
to assist her in transferring them across the way.
The two worked together, and as they labored
they talked, Jerry telling her a good deal about
his mission to New York and the girl relating her
own experiences in keeping the wolf from the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were not always poor,” said Nellie Ardell.
“When father was alive we lived in our own home
in Brooklyn. But he grew interested in a Western
land scheme and it took all of his money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was our trouble. I came to New York
to see what I could do toward making Alexander
Slocum give an accounting of the money he put in
a California land scheme for my uncle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, my father was in Slocum’s land scheme!”
she ejaculated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps it was the same. This land scheme I
speak of was called the Judge Martin—why, I
don’t know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the same. It was so called because the
land once belonged to a Judge Martin of Colorado.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course, Jerry was deeply interested, and, the
moving finished, he and she sat down to talk the
matter over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From what our hero learned of Nellie Ardell he
<span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span>
came to the conclusion that Alexander Slocum
was every inch the villain he had taken him to be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The real estate dealer had hoodwinked the girl
completely, and she had surrendered to him all
the documents her parent had left behind at the
time of his death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s too bad,” said Jerry. “We must work together
against him. But nothing can be done until
my missing papers are recovered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before he left, another matter was discussed and
settled. In her new quarters Nellie Ardell had a
small room she did not really need, and she offered
to board Jerry at three dollars and a half a week.
As this would be an acceptable saving just at present,
our hero accepted the offer and agreed to
make the change on the following Monday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sunday passed quietly. Jerry spent part of the
day in writing a long letter home, telling the folks
just how matters stood and urging them not to
worry, as he felt certain all would come out right
in the end, and that he was quite content to remain
in New York and support himself until he
had settled matters with Alexander Slocum. The
letter was finished late in the afternoon, and after
taking supper he went out to post it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The novelty of life in the city had not yet
passed, and, the letter put into a corner box, the
young oarsman sauntered on and on, taking in
the many strange sights.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span>
He had gone a distance of half a dozen blocks
when he came to a church. The doors were wide
open, and as the congregation were singing, he
stopped to listen to the music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the music stopped, our hero passed on
down the street, which seemed to grow poorer as
he advanced. The new houses gave place to those
that were very old, and on all sides Jerry could
see the effects of grinding poverty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a great city,” he thought. “And it is
true that one half doesn’t know how the other
half lives.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please, mister, will you give me five cents?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry stopped in his walk and looked down to
see who had addressed him. It was a little girl,
and she was crying bitterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Five cents?” he repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, mister; please don’t say no. I’ve asked
so many for the money already and they won’t
give me a cent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you going to do with five cents?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got to bring it home to daddy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To daddy—you mean your father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a sort of a father, but he’s not my real
papa,” sobbed the little girl. “He took me when
papa died.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does your—your daddy want with the
five cents?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this question the little girl’s face flushed.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='197' id='Page_197'></span>
“I—I daren’t tell you—daddy would whip me,”
she whimpered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does he drink?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I daren’t tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does he send you out very often to beg?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He sends me out when he’s—when he’s—but I
daren’t tell you. He would whip me most to
death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where do you live?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Over there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the little girl pointed to a long row of rear
tenements, the very worst-looking in the neighborhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what is daddy’s name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His real name is James MacHenry, but the
folks around here all call him Crazy Jim,” she
answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry started back in surprise. Crazy Jim was
the tramp who had been seen walking off with his
packet of documents!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you live with Crazy Jim?” said our hero,
to the little girl, slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long have you lived with him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, a long while, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take me to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this request she drew back in horror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I can’t do that, indeed I can’t,” she faltered.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span>
“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I took a man to him once—a charity officer—and
daddy—whip—whipped me for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then show me where he lives,” went on Jerry
after a pause. “You needn’t let him see you. I
must have a talk with him. Perhaps I’ll give him
some money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little girl still hesitated, but finally led the
way up the street into a horrible-looking alley and
pointed to a dingy tenement-house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daddy is up there on the top floor in the
back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And is that where you live?” asked Jerry, with
a shudder he could not repress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not a nice place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no,” and something like a tear glistened in
the girl’s eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is ten cents for you,” added Jerry.
“You had better keep it for yourself. Are you
hungry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little. I only had some bread to-day for dinner
and supper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then go down to the restaurant on the corner
and get something to eat for the money. You
need it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little girl ran off to do as bidden, and our
hero entered the dilapidated tenement. Four
dirty men and women sat on the stoop smoking
and drinking from a tin pail.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span>
“Who are ye lookin’ fer?” asked one of the
men, roughly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Crazy Jim,” answered Jerry, briefly, and
brushed past him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hallway was dark, and it was with difficulty
that the young oarsman found the rickety stairs,
every step of which creaked as he trod upon it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arriving at the top floor, the youth noticed a
shaft of light streaming from beneath a door in
the rear. He knocked loudly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a movement within, the door was
flung back, and Jerry found himself confronted by
a tall, round-shouldered individual, with long, unkempt
hair and a wild look in his small black eyes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>THE LITTLE NOBODY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Well!” demanded the man laconically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is this James MacHenry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s me, boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would like to see you on business,” Jerry
went on, as he brushed past and entered one of the
barest living apartments he had ever seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On business?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, a few days ago you picked up a packet
downtown belonging to me—a packet containing
some documents and letters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who said they belonged to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say so. My name is Jerry Upton, and I
dropped the packet in the alleyway where you
found it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man stared at our hero.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, is this a game?” he demanded, harshly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you trying to get me into trouble?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I am trying to keep you out of trouble,”
replied the young oarsman, warmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You say that packet belonged to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='201' id='Page_201'></span>
“It didn’t have your name on it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it—” Our hero stopped short. “It had
Alexander Slocum’s name on it!” he burst out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t mean to say you delivered that
packet to him?” gasped the youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did—not an hour ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry fell back into a chair and breathed heavily.
The packet was gone—into the hands of the
enemy!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The man said it was his package,” said Crazy
Jim. “He gave me a reward of five dollars for
returning it to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was mine. He wanted to steal it—and now
he’s done it,” cried Jerry. “You let him have it
but an hour ago?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where did he go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you open the packet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but I couldn’t make nothing out of it—’cos
I ain’t eddicated. I read his name on it
and got another fellow to write a postal card
yesterday afternoon. He came here, examined
the papers, and seemed much pleased.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No doubt he was pleased,” groaned the young
oarsman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was the thing worth much?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was worth a good deal. I would have given
five dollars to get it back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='202' id='Page_202'></span>
“What does he want with it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wants to do my father out of some property,”
answered our hero. “By the way, who is that
little girl who lives with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this question Crazy Jim’s face darkened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That ain’t none of your business,” he growled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shouldn’t send her out on the street to
beg.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wot! has she been blabbin’ again? I’ll break
every bone in her body!” and off the man
started out of the room and down the narrow
stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry had noticed that his breath smelt strongly
of liquor. He was not only a drinking man, but
also one who was not quite right in his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t hurt her, you brute!” called out the
boy, and followed him out of the alleyway into
the street. At the nearest corner stood the little
girl, and Crazy Jim rushed up to her fiercely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You good-fer-nothin’!” he bawled. “I’ll teach
ye a lesson! Didn’t I tell ye ter keep yer clapper
still about me? Take that! and that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He raised his heavy hand and struck her a cruel
blow on the side of the head. She staggered back,
and he was about to repeat his unjust action,
when Jerry thought it about time to interfere.
Catching him by the arm, our hero hurled him
backward with such force that he fell flat in the
gutter.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span>
At once a shout went up from those who saw
Jerry’s action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are yer doin’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is that boy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a fearful exclamation, Crazy Jim arose to
his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll fix ye fer that!” he hissed, and sprang forward.
“You ain’t got no right ter interfere between
me an’ the gal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a brute!” burst out our hero. “This
little girl has done nothing to deserve such punishment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who set you over me?” howled the infuriated
man. “I’ll fix ye!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tried his best to hit Jerry with his fist, but
the young oarsman dodged him and took a stand
in front of the little girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You had better run away,” Jerry whispered to
her. “He is in a terrible mood just now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where shall I go?” whimpered the girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anywhere? Up two blocks. I will join you
soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without delay the little girl ran off. Crazy Jim
tried to follow her, but Jerry headed him off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seeing he could do nothing with his hands, the
savage man looked around for some weapon. A
heavy stone was lying handy, and he picked it up.
The next moment it was launched at our hero’s
head.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span>
Luckily, Jerry was quick at dodging, or he
might have been seriously wounded. The missile
went sailing over the lad’s head and flew with a
crash through the front window of a neighboring
store.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The smashing of the pane of glass was followed
by a shout of alarm from the storekeeper, who sat
in a chair on the pavement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, vot’s dot?” he yelled. “Vot you means
py preaking mine vinder, hey, you Crazy Gim? I
vos got you locked up. Ain’t it? Bolice! bolice!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German storekeeper continued to yell so
loudly that it was not long before an officer appeared.
Seeing this, Jerry backed out of the
crowd and hurried off. He saw the policeman
catch Crazy Jim by the arm, and a wordy war followed.
A minute later the fellow was being
marched off to the station-house. No doubt the
policeman would have liked it had he found Jerry,
but our hero kept at a safe distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was now quite dark, and it was with some difficulty
that Jerry again found the little girl. She
stood by a hitching post, sobbing bitterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is he?” she asked, choking back her
sobs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The policeman took him off. Don’t cry any
more,” Jerry added, soothingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But where shall I go?” she asked. “I can’t go
back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span>
“Have you no friends?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Crazy Jim and I came to New York alone
when papa died.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where did you come from?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little girl shook her head at this. She had
been too young to remember.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is your name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dottie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dottie what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing, only Dottie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry was in a quandary. To a certain degree
he felt responsible for her present forlorn condition.
Suddenly an idea struck him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you will come with me, I’ll see to it that you
have a good bed to-night, and breakfast in the
morning,” he said. “And after that I’ll see what
I can do for you, Dottie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My name is Jerry Upton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look like a nice boy and I’ll go with you,”
and she placed her hand confidently in that of the
young oarsman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry took the little one to Nellie Ardell’s apartments.
Of course she was much surprised, and,
sitting down, our hero had to explain everything
as far as he was able. Nellie Ardell agreed instantly
to take the little girl in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can stay here until we can do something
for you,” she said. “I know how it would feel to
have little Tommy on the streets homeless.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span>
And soon after that Dottie was put to bed, very
well content. Her hard life with Crazy Jim had
made her used to ups and downs that no ordinary
little girl could have endured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reader can well imagine that Jerry did not
sleep much that night. He could not forget that
Alexander Slocum had the precious packet of
papers. Bitterly he regretted not having taken
better care of the documents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will call on Slocum, and come to some sort of
an understanding,” Jerry said to himself. “Perhaps
when I tell him that both Nellie Ardell and
myself are ready to proceed against him he will be
willing to come to terms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day was a busy one at the book-bindery,
and our hero got no chance to call on Slocum.
During that time he learned that Crazy Jim had
been locked up for resisting the officer and had
been sentenced to thirty days on Blackwell’s
Island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young oarsman did not know what to do
about little Dottie, but Nellie Ardell solved this
question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have received a whole lot of new work,” she
said. “So for the present we can keep her to mind
Tommy while I am dressmaking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the little girl stayed on. Jerry never
dreamed of how much she had to do with his future
life.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span>
On Thursday Mr. Islen’s brother died and the
bindery was closed for several days. Jerry took
the opportunity to walk down to Alexander Slocum’s
offices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The real estate man was alone, and greeted our
hero with a sinister smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you have seen fit to call again, young
man,” were his first words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Slocum, let us come to business,” Jerry replied
firmly. “What are you going to do about
my father’s claim?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alexander Slocum laughed harshly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your father’s claim?” he repeated. “I don’t
recognize the fact that your father has any claim
against me.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>ALEXANDER SLOCUM SHOWS HIS HAND.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Alexander Slocum’s statement was no more
than Jerry had expected, so he was not taken
back by the words. He looked the man steadily
in the eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So that is the position you are going to take
now—since you received my packet from James
MacHenry,” said Jerry, deliberately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slocum started and winced, and the young oarsman
saw that Crazy Jim had spoken the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t anything belonging to you, Upton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is useless for you to deny it, Mr. Slocum. He
found the packet and delivered it to you for a reward
of five dollars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The packet he delivered to me was my own. It
contained some legal documents belonging to this
office.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may make others believe that, Mr. Slocum,
but—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what, boy? Remember, I want none of
your insolence here. I will listen to you, but you
mustn’t grow impertinent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m only speaking the truth. You virtually
<span class='pageno' title='209' id='Page_209'></span>
robbed me, just as you robbed my father and Mr.
Bryant Ardell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha!” Slocum leaped to his feet. “Who—where
did you hear of Bryant Ardell?” he asked,
excitedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have met Nellie Ardell several times—in fact,
I am boarding with her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did she set you to hounding me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; we met by accident after I had come to
New York almost on purpose to see you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is an impudent young woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She told me that you had her land papers,
just as you now have mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a falsehood!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If both of us go to court with our story, we
may prove that it is not a falsehood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! are you going to combine to ruin my
reputation?” cried the real estate dealer, growing
pale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are going to try to obtain our rights.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll gain nothing. I’ll—I’ll have you locked
up on a charge of black-mail!” Alexander Slocum
began to pace his office nervously. “See
here, Upton how much do you want to go off and
leave me alone?” he questioned, suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want what is due my father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll not get it!” he whispered, hoarsely,
throwing his mask aside. “Do you think I have
plotted and worked all these years for nothing?
<span class='pageno' title='210' id='Page_210'></span>
Not much! All that property is mine, do you
hear? Nobody else shall ever own a foot of it.
Now, I’ll tell you what I am willing to do. I’ll
give you a hundred dollars in cash and we’ll call it
square. Mind you, I don’t admit your claim. I
only want to avoid trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry looked at the man and drew a long breath.
He could see through Slocum’s words as clearly as
he could see through the window. His father’s
claim was worth a fortune!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, what do you say?” demanded Slocum
as Jerry did not answer him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say this, Mr. Slocum,” rejoined our hero. “I
won’t accept your proposition, and before I am
done with you I’ll have our rights and you’ll be in
state’s prison.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a snarl very much like that made by a
fretful tiger, the man leaped toward the boy as if
to grab him by the throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You fool! I’ll make you come to terms!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His hand touched Jerry’s collar, but the young
oarsman evaded him and placed the flat-top desk
between them. When the man ran around the
desk, Jerry picked up a heavy brass-bound ruler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop, or I’ll crack you with this!” cried our
hero, and, seeing the weapon, Slocum halted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be a fool, boy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t intend to be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can do nothing against me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span>
“That remains to be seen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who will take your word against mine? Nobody.
You are a mere country lad, while I am a
well-known New York citizen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Ardell was also well known in his day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Alexander Slocum’s face grew pale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nellie Ardell has no doubt urged you to attack
me,” he growled. “I must see her. Why didn’t
she come with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is busy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will explain matters to her in detail. Really,
the claim is not worth anything, but I wish to
avoid trouble, and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might as well stop, Mr. Slocum, for it’s
too late to say that now. I am positive our
claims are of great value. Since you won’t do the
right thing, I shall advise my father to bring
action in court to compel you to come to terms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While speaking, Jerry had walked to the door,
and now placed his hand on the knob.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop! stop!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I have had enough for the present.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You villain!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slocum ran toward Jerry, who opened the door
to step out, but found the way blockaded by
Casey, his book-keeper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, what’s up?” cried the man, in wonder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t let him get away, Casey!” cried Alexander
Slocum. “He is going to make trouble, sure!”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='212' id='Page_212'></span>
“Let me go!” burst out our hero as the book-keeper
caught hold of him. “Let go, or I’ll——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry never finished that sentence. Alexander
Slocum had picked up the ruler the youth had
dropped, and leaped to the front. Down came the
weapon on the young oarsman’s head; he felt a
sharp stinging pain—and then he knew no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Jerry came to his senses all was dark
around him. He was lying on a damp, cement
floor, evidently that of a cellar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His head ached greatly, and for several minutes
he could not remember what had happened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then came back that scene in Slocum’s office.
He staggered to his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Where was he and how long had he been there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first question was readily answered. Stepping
forward, Jerry stumbled over some loose
coal. He was in a coal-cellar. Around and above
were brick walls. The door was of sheet-iron, and
it was tightly closed and barred. How had he
come to that place? Probably his enemies had
carried him hither, although how they could do it
without being seen was a question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as our hero felt strong enough he
looked about for some means of escaping from his
prison. With great care he examined the walls
and tried the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finding no outlet on any side, he turned his attention
to the pavements above. From one spot
<span class='pageno' title='213' id='Page_213'></span>
there came a faint glimmer of light, in a circle, and
he rightfully guessed that the coal-hole was located
there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How to reach the hole was a problem. It was
several feet above our hero’s head, and there was
nothing in the coal-vault to stand upon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry considered the situation for a minute, and
then, standing directly under the cover of the hole,
leaped upward, sending his hand over his head as
he did so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cover was loose, and the force of the blow
caused it to fly upward. Another blow and it fell
away entirely, and in a second more the young
oarsman was clambering out of the opening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was drawing towards evening, and the street
was full of people, some of which eyed the boy
curiously. Restoring the cover to its place, he left
the spot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The question now was, should he return to Slocum’s
office or seek outside assistance? He decided
upon the latter course. To attempt to bring
the rascally real estate agent to terms alone
would be foolhardy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry’s head ached so much he could think only
with difficulty, and he decided to return to Nellie
Ardell’s apartments. It was a hard walk, and he
was glad when the place was reached and he could
sit down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter—are you hurt?” cried the
young woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span>
“I was knocked out,” replied the youth, with a
sorry little laugh. “I’ve got a pretty big lump on
the top of my head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sitting down, he told his story, to which Nellie
Ardell listened with breathless attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The wicked man! He should be locked up!”
she burst out, when Jerry had finished. “It’s a
wonder he didn’t kill you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s true. As it was, the blow was awfully
hard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What will you do now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I really don’t know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t that Mr. Islen whom you work for, help
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps he will,” returned the youth, struck
with the idea. “The trouble is his brother is dead,
and that has upset him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One thing is certain, Jerry, the property is valuable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and another thing is certain,” added our
hero. “We want our shares of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be a great help to me to get some
money out of it,” said Nellie Ardell, with a sigh.
“This sewing constantly day in and day out is
wearing on me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two talked for over an hour, and then Jerry
felt compelled to lie down. It was nearly morning
before his head stopped aching and he got some
rest.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXXV.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>A STRANGE DISAPPEARANCE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>On the next day the bindery was opened as
usual, but Mr. Islen did not appear, having gone
to Philadelphia. Jerry worked throughout the
day, wondering what Alexander Slocum had
thought and done after he had discovered the
escape. Little did the young oarsman dream of
what the real estate dealer was then doing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our hero was proving himself to be skillful at
the work assigned to him and the foreman often
praised him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll be worth a raise in wages,” he said.
“I never saw a boy take hold as you do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry never delayed after the day’s work was
over. He washed up, put on his coat, and hurried
forth to his boarding place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Jerry reached the house he found little
Dottie on the stoop, with Tommy in her arms.
Tommy was crying for something to eat, and the
little girl was having her hands full with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is Miss Nellie?” asked our hero in some
surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” returned the girl. “She sent
<span class='pageno' title='216' id='Page_216'></span>
me out with Tommy after dinner, and when I
tried to get in after awhile the door was locked
and she was gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you have been sitting here ever since?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come up. I’ll open the door.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry led the way, and with a night key opened
the door to the kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A cry of surprise burst from his lips. Everywhere
were the signs of a desperate struggle. Two
of the chairs were overturned, the table-cloth hung
half off the table, and Nellie Ardell’s sewing was
strewn in all directions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is Slocum’s work!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those were the words which arose to the youth’s
lips as he surveyed the situation in the kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alexander Slocum had tried to get him out of
the way, and now he had tried the same plan upon
Nellie Ardell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There had been a fierce struggle, of that there
was not the slightest doubt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the girl had been overpowered in the end
and taken off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To where?</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was the all-important question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While our hero was gazing around the room, little
Tommy was crying at the top of his lungs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To quiet him, Jerry gave him his bowl of bread
and milk, and also gave Dottie her supper.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='217' id='Page_217'></span>
Then Jerry began a minute examination of the
rooms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was mud on the oil-cloth—the tracks of
four boots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Slocum and Casey, his book-keeper,” he said
to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Going below he interviewed Mrs. Flannigan, a
good-natured Irish woman who lived on the next
floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you see Miss Ardell this afternoon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure, an’ Oi did not Oi was out,” she replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He next tried the janitress, who lived in the
basement. She was a peppery old woman who
seldom had a pleasant word for anybody.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did I see her? Yes, she went out with two
men about two hours ago,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What sort of looking men?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t say—I’m not taking notice of everybody
who comes and goes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But this is important, Mrs. Foley. I am
afraid something has happened to Miss Ardell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They were tall men, and I guess both had big
black mustaches and beards.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where did she go with them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Into a carriage. All of ’em seemed to be in a
big hurry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which way did the carriage go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Down towards the Brooklyn ferry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a thoughtful mood, the young oarsman
<span class='pageno' title='218' id='Page_218'></span>
walked back upstairs. He met Mrs. Flannigan
outside of the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s wrong, Mr. Upton?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is what I am trying to find out. Miss
Ardell is missing. If I go out, will you look after
the children?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure, Oi will, bless the dears,” she said. Her
heart was as large as her ruddy, full-blown face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without waiting longer, Jerry ran down into
the street and endeavored to trace the carriage
down to the ferry. In this he was successful, and
learned that the turnout containing two men and
a young lady, who appeared to be ill, had crossed
to Brooklyn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time night had set in, and all efforts to
follow the carriage proved unsuccessful. Yet unwilling
to give up, Jerry spent over two hours in
Brooklyn, hunting in every direction for a clew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our hero had never been across the East River
before, and in hunting around it was but natural
that he should get lost. At the end of the search
he found himself a good distance from the river, in
a neighborhood that looked anything but respectable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s time I got back,” thought the youth, and
started to make inquiries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a dozen blocks out of your way,” said a
man. “Go down that way three blocks, and turn
to your left.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='219' id='Page_219'></span>
As Jerry walked along a somewhat gloomy
street, he noticed three men walking ahead of him.
One was a tall, finely built man, wearing a large
round hat, of the western type.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other men were short fellows, each with a
red mustache. They carried heavy canes and
walked on either side of the tall individual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t we almost there?” Jerry heard the tall
man ask, as he drew closer to the trio.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it ain’t but a step further,” was the reply
from one of the short men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are certain this Crazy Jim is the man I am
after?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mentioning of Crazy Jim’s name interested
Jerry. Crazy Jim was still up on Blackwell’s
Island. It was possible, however, that they referred
to some other individual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To hear what further they might have to say
the young oarsman kept close to the party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s been a long hunt for me, gentlemen,” said
the tall man, and by his speech Jerry felt sure he
was a westerner. “But if I am on the right trail,
things will soon come out right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you want to find Crazy Jim for?”
asked one of the short men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not saying anything about that just now,”
was the cool response.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, excuse me, of course not.” The short fellow
<span class='pageno' title='220' id='Page_220'></span>
looked around, but failed to catch sight of our
hero. “Jack, how about a smoke?” he said to
the other short fellow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strike a light,” was the answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The words were evidently a secret signal, for
hardly were they spoken when one of the short
men caught the westerner from behind and held
his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, what’s the meaning of this?” cried the
man, in alarm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep still, old man, and we won’t hurt you.
Raise a row and you’ll get knocked out. Quick,
Pete, with his diamond pin and that roll of bills in
his left pocket!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this command the man in front rushed in and
caught hold of the man’s pin. Out it came in his
hand, a beautiful affair, worth at least a hundred
dollars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop! stop!” yelled the westerner. “Police!
police!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shut up!” hissed the man who held him.
“Pete, crack him over the head. We can’t afford
to take any chances here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus ordered, the man who held the diamond
pin slipped it into his pocket. Then he raised his
heavy cane and started to do as bidden when
Jerry rushed at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop! Don’t hit that man!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rascal was surprised.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='221' id='Page_221'></span>
“Who are you? Oh, it’s only a boy. Clear out
of here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t! You let that man alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t leave me,” pleaded the victim. “They
want to rob me. He has my diamond pin!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shut up!” howled the man in the rear. “Crack
him, Pete, and crack the boy, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more the heavy cane was raised. Our hero
caught it in the center, and by a dexterous twist
wrenched it from the rascal’s hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a howl of baffled rage the rascal turned
and caught Jerry by the throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me that stick, boy, or I’ll choke the life
out of you!” he hissed into the youth’s ear.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>JERRY HEARS AN ASTONISHING STATEMENT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>When the footpad, for the fellow was nothing
less, attacked Jerry, our hero felt that he had a
tough struggle before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rascal’s grasp on the young oarsman’s
throat was light, however, and Jerry quickly
shook it off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime the westerner began to struggle
and shout at the top of his voice:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Help! Police! police!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In vain the fellow who held him tried to stop his
cries. They grew louder, and soon footsteps were
heard approaching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry received a savage blow on the chest and
struck out in return, hitting the footpad in the
chin. Then the two clinched, and both rolled to
the pavement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry’s assailant was a strong man and he was
slowly but surely getting the best of the youth
when three men put in an appearance. They were
heavy-set individuals and were followed by a policeman.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='223' id='Page_223'></span>
“What’s up here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t kill that boy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is a thief!” cried Jerry. “He has that
man’s diamond pin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right,” put in the westerner, who had
managed to turn and catch hold of his assailant.
“This fellow is his mate. They just tackled me
when the boy came to my help.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a falsehood,” roared the footpad who had
attacked our hero.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Saying this, he arose and tried to sneak away.
But Jerry tripped him up, sending him headlong,
and before he could rise the policeman had him
handcuffed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While this was going on the westerner and two
of the new arrivals managed to make a prisoner of
the other footpad. He used some terrible language,
but this did not avail him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know them,” said the policeman, after the
capture was effected. “They are Hungry Pete and
Jack the Slick. They are wanted for a burglary at
Sheepshead Bay. How did you happen to fall in
with them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I met them up at Rumford’s Hotel. They said
they knew a man I was looking for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you come along and make a charge
against them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly. He has my diamond pin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pin was brought to light and handed over
<span class='pageno' title='224' id='Page_224'></span>
to its owner, and then our hero was asked to go
along.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anxious to know what the westerner might
want of Crazy Jim, Jerry agreed, and a minute
later found the whole crowd bound for the nearest
station-house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here the westerner gave his name as Colonel
Albert Dartwell. He said he was from Denver and
had come east on private business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been sick for two months,” he said. “I
am still weak. That is the reason I did not put
up a better fight when those two men tackled me.”
Jerry told his story, and the upshot of the matter
was that the two footpads were held for another
hearing before the judge in the morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My boy, I owe you something for your services
to me,” said the westerner, as he and our hero
came out on the street. “You did well for a boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did the best I could,” replied the young oarsman.
“But I want to ask you a question. I heard
you mention Crazy Jim. What do you want to
see him for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A look of pain crossed Colonel Dartwell’s face at
my words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a long story, Upton. I am from the West
and came many miles to see him. Do you know
the man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know one fellow called Crazy Jim, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His right name is James MacHenry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='225' id='Page_225'></span>
“That’s the man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! And where can he be found?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most likely on Blackwell’s Island.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is in prison?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For breaking the glass in a store window and
creating a row.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Colonel Dartwell drew a long breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those footpads told me he was in a hotel in
the neighborhood. You are sure you are right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir. To be truthful, I was mixed up in
the scrape that took Crazy Jim to prison.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed. Would you mind telling me about
it? You don’t look like a boy that would do
wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wasn’t my fault. Crazy Jim had a packet
belonging to me—a packet containing some valuable
documents. I called for them and found he
had given them up to an enemy of mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that led to the row.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not exactly. He is a bad man, and there was
a little girl living with him, and he—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Jerry spoke Colonel Dartwell grasped him by
the arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop! What did you say about a little girl?”
he demanded, eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said there was a little girl living with him.
He used to send her out to beg. He got it into
<span class='pageno' title='226' id='Page_226'></span>
his head that she had set me against him, and he
started to beat her. I told her to run away, and
then he attacked me and got arrested.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what became of the little girl? Tell me,
quickly!” And Colonel Dartwell’s voice was husky
as he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I met her afterward and took her to where I
was boarding, and she is still stopping there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Describe her to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seeing there was something behind the inquiry,
Jerry gave him the best description he could.
The colonel listened with fixed attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must be her!” he murmured. “My poor,
lost Dottie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dottie! That’s her name!” cried our hero.
“And she is—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is my daughter,” was his answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your daughter!” ejaculated Jerry, in amazement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, my daughter. Take me to her at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will, sir; but this is the strangest thing I ever
heard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no doubt of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was she stolen from you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. It’s a long story. I will tell it to you
while we are on the way. She is well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir. But she has been misused, so you
mustn’t expect to see her looking real good. She
is very thin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='227' id='Page_227'></span>
“I have not seen her for four years, not since she
was a mite of a toddler.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pair started for the ferry without delay, and
as they proceeded, the colonel related his story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a mine-owner and had lived in the West
for fifteen years. His wife had died when Dottie
was born, and the child had been turned over to
the care of a colored nurse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that time James MacHenry had been a prospector
in the region and he had opened a mine
close to that located by the colonel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All went well until the MacHenry mine petered
out, as it is called, and then the man’s mind became
deranged. He accused the colonel of having
cheated him out of a slice of the richest land and a
bitter quarrel resulted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two weeks later MacHenry disappeared, and
shortly after that baby Dottie was missing. A
long search was made for the child, but without
avail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Curiously enough, the colonel did not connect
the disappearance of his child with that of Crazy
Jim. He started to hunt for the little one among
the Indians and the outlaws in the mountains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two years passed, and then one night a good-for-nothing
miner named Duffy was shot in a quarrel
over a game of cards. On his dying bed Duffy
confessed that he had once been intimate with
Crazy Jim and that the latter had acknowledged
stealing Dottie.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='228' id='Page_228'></span>
A hunt was at once made for the abductor. It
was said he had gone to San Francisco, and later
on he was traced to Chicago, but there the trail
was lost until long after, when a tramp turned up
who spoke of having seen Crazy Jim around
New York.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without delay Colonel Dartwell had come East
and scoured the metropolis. While here he had
fallen in with footpads who had sought to rob
him.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>A JOYOUS MEETING.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>By the time Colonel Dartwell’s story was told
he and Jerry had landed in the metropolis, and a
hurried walk of a few minutes brought them to
Nellie Ardell’s apartment. Mrs. Flannigan was
waiting for our hero, having put both of the
children to bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An’ did ye find Miss Ardell?” she asked,
quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Mrs. Flannigan. But I have found somebody
else—the father of little Dottie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indade, now! An’ ain’t that noice,” she exclaimed,
glancing at Colonel Dartwell’s well-dressed
figure. “Well, the poor dear needs somebody,
not but what she got good care here,” she added,
hastily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tears stood in the colonel’s eyes as he stepped
up beside the bed upon which Dottie lay. He took
the white-robed figure up in his arms and kissed
her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is she,” he said, in a choking voice. “The
living picture of her dead mother!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dottie awoke with a start and was inclined to
<span class='pageno' title='230' id='Page_230'></span>
cry out. But Jerry and the colonel quickly
soothed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am your papa, Dottie; don’t you remember
papa and big Ruth that used to be with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little girl looked puzzled. Then she gave a
cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Papa! papa! I know you! I knew you would
come to me! Oh, papa, don’t go away again!
Crazy Jim said you were dead! Oh, papa!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she clung to him convulsively. It was such
an affecting scene Jerry had to turn away, while
Mrs. Flannigan, standing in the partly open doorway,
shed copious tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour later the children had again retired,
and the colonel and the young oarsman sat in the
little kitchen talking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you say you think Miss Ardell was abducted?”
he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I felt sure of it, sir. This Alexander Slocum
wants to get her out of the way on account of
some property he is holding back from her. I am
interested in the same property.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Jerry told him the particulars of affairs so
far as they concerned Slocum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the land in question is near Sacramento it
ought to be of great value,” said the colonel.
“Property in that section is booming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to find Nellie Ardell, sir. I am afraid
he will do her bodily harm. He might even kill
her to get her out of the way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='231' id='Page_231'></span>
“I will help you all I can, Upton. You have
done me a great service, and I certainly owe the
young lady much for taking my child in and caring
for her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our hero and the colonel went over the matter
carefully for fully an hour and decided to start on
a hunt as soon as it grew light. The colonel
offered to employ a detective and this offer Jerry
readily accepted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry passed several hours trying to sleep, and
at the first sign of dawn was up and dressed. The
colonel had rested in an arm-chair, not caring to
separate himself from his child by going to a
hotel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Flannigan was again called upon and readily
agreed to take charge of Tommy and Dottie
once more. She took them to her own rooms and
was cautioned about letting strangers in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t fear, they’ll not take ’em from me,” she
said, and in such a determined way that Jerry was
compelled to laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The call at a detective’s office was soon over,
and it was not as satisfactory as our hero had
anticipated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mustn’t expect too much,” laughed the
colonel. “In spite of the thrilling detective stories
published, detectives are only ordinary men,
and cannot do the impossible. Mr. Gray will no
doubt go to work in his own way and do the best
he can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='232' id='Page_232'></span>
Their next movement was to cross to Brooklyn.
Here the pair started on the hunt for the carriage
that had carried Nellie Ardell off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour was spent in a fruitless search. They
were about to give it up, when they saw a carriage
coming down to the ferry that was covered with
dust and mud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That looks as if it had been out in the country
a good distance,” observed Colonel Dartwell.
“I’ll stop the driver and see what he has to say.
It can do no harm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Walking up in front of the team he motioned for
the driver to halt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Want a carriage, boss?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I want to know where you have been?” demanded
the westerner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this question the driver seemed plainly disconcerted.
He looked around, and, seeing a clear
space to his left, whipped up his animals and sped
off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s our man!” cried the colonel. “Come on,
he must not escape us!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He set off with all speed and Jerry followed.
The driver drove as far as the first corner and then
had to halt because of a blockade in the street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come down here!” commanded Colonel Dartwell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ain’t done nothin’,” growled the fellow.
“You let me alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='233' id='Page_233'></span>
“I asked you where you had been.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Up to the park.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who did you have for a fare?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An old man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s not true—you had two men and a girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The carriage driver muttered something under
his breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I—who said I had the men and a girl?” he
asked, surlily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say so. Where did you take the young
lady?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first the driver beat about the bush. But the
colonel threatened him with arrest, and this
brought him around.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t arrest me, boss. I wasn’t in the game.
The men hired me to take ’em out—that was all.
They said the girl was light-headed and the place
was a private asylum.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Probably,” rejoined Colonel Dartwell, sarcastically.
“Take us to that place without delay.
But stop—drive to police headquarters first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very unwillingly the fellow complied. At the
headquarters help was procured in the shape of
two ward detectives. All four of the party entered
the carriage and were driven off to effect Nellie
Ardell’s rescue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was with deep interest that Jerry accompanied
Colonel Dartwell and the officers of the law
in the search for the missing young lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='234' id='Page_234'></span>
On through the crowded streets of Brooklyn
drove the carriage, the driver now apparently as
willing to help the law as he had before wished to
evade it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The carriage was turning into one of the fine
thoroughfares when Jerry caught sight of a figure
which instantly arrested his attention. The figure
was that of Mr. Wakefield Smith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop!” cried the young oarsman to the driver
of the carriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s up?” demanded the colonel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you see that man over there by the paper
stand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is Wakefield Smith, the pickpocket.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed! He ought to be arrested.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know him to be a pickpocket?” questioned
one of the detectives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do. He robbed me of over twenty dollars. I
got back ten dollars. He’s a very smooth and
slick worker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I know that chap,” returned the detective.
“Don’t he look like Charley the Dude?” he
asked of his companion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By Jove! that’s our man!” ejaculated the second
detective. “I would know him anywhere by
that peculiar walk. He has grown a heavy mustache
since I saw him last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you stop and arrest him?” asked Jerry.
“He ought to be locked up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='235' id='Page_235'></span>
“We can get the policeman on the beat to attend
to him. There is an officer on the next corner.
Just call him, Harrity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The carriage was brought up to the curb and
our hero and the officers alighted, the Colonel remaining
behind to keep an eye on the driver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Wakefield Smith was strolling down the
street in a lordly way when Jerry tapped him on
the shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I’ve met you again,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pickpocket turned and his face fell. But
only for a moment; then he gazed at the youth
brazenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know you, me boy,” he drawled in an
assumed voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I know you, Mr. Smith,” rejoined Jerry.
“I want the balance of my money. I got ten dollars
the night you were intoxicated, but that is
not enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Boy, you are talking riddles. I never saw
you before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can easily prove it, I fancy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s no use, Charley,” broke in the detective,
who had followed him. “We know you well
enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And who are you?” asked the pickpocket,
much disconcerted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am a detective. You are the rogue known
as Charley the Dude. You may consider yourself
under arrest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='236' id='Page_236'></span>
“This is an outrage!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hardly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time the second detective had arrived
with a policeman. At sight of the bluecoat the
pickpocket became nervous. Turning, he suddenly
started to run.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the others ran for him, and soon he was
handcuffed. Explanations to the policeman
followed, and the officer took him off, and Jerry
and the detectives continued on their way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may be well to state here that the pickpocket,
whose real name was Charles Heulig, was later on
convicted of several crimes and sent to state
prison for a term of years. Jerry never received a
cent of the balance of the money due, but other
events that followed made this loss seem a trivial
one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In half an hour after the arrest of the pickpocket
the young oarsman and his companions found
themselves on the outskirts of Brooklyn and bowling
along a smooth country road which the detectives
said they knew well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On and on they went, until Colonel Dartwell
asked the driver how much further they had to go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About half a mile, sir,” was the answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His words proved correct. Turning into a side
road, the carriage came to the entrance to a large
grounds, surrounded by a high board fence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over the gateway was the sign:</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:.8em;'>DR. HALCONE’S PRIVATE SANITARIUM.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A private lunatic asylum,” murmured Colonel
Dartwell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir,” said the driver. “You know I told
you they said the young lady was a bit off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What shall we do?” was the question put by
the westerner to the detectives. “Shall we go in
boldly and order them to produce the girl?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will they do it?” asked Jerry. “They may be
in Slocum’s pay, and hide her away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='238' id='Page_238'></span>
“The young man is right,” said one of the detectives.
“We’ll drive on a way and then sneak
back and size the place up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was done, and five minutes later found the
colonel and our hero walking along a hedge
which separated the grounds on one side from a
woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look there!” Jerry cried suddenly, and pointed
to an upper window of the brick building beyond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had seen Nellie Ardell’s face as the young
lady walked about the apartment. As the others
gazed upward Alexander Slocum appeared. He
held a sheet of paper and a pen in his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He wants her to sign something,” cried our
hero in a low voice. “See! see! he is going to
force her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave me be, Mr. Slocum,” those below heard
Nellie Ardell exclaim. “I will not sign off my interest
in that property. Leave me be! Oh, that
somebody was at hand to help me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on—there is no time to waste!” cried
Colonel Dartwell, and pushed through the hedge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry followed, and both ran for a side door of
the building, which stood open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here they found themselves confronted by a
burly man of advanced age, evidently the proprietor
of the sanitarium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, what do you want here?” he demanded,
roughly.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='239' id='Page_239'></span>
“We want that young lady upstairs!” cried
Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t have her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll see about that,” put in Colonel Dartwell.
“You have no authority to detain her here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is insane, and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Help! help!” came from upstairs, and rushing
past the burly doctor, Jerry skipped up the stairs,
three steps at a time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The colonel came behind. The doctor was about
to remonstrate when he found himself confronted
by the two detectives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our hero and the colonel soon found the proper
door. It was locked, but putting his shoulder to
it the young oarsman soon burst it open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alexander Slocum stood at the table in the center
of the room. He had Nellie Ardell by the
wrist, and was endeavoring to force her to sign
the paper before them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave her alone, you villain!” cried Jerry, and
dragged him backward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jerry Upton!” exclaimed the young woman,
and her tone was full of joy. “Oh, how thankful
I am that you have come!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What—what is the meaning of this?” asked
Slocum, turning deadly pale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It means that you have been found out, Alexander
Slocum,” replied our hero. “We have
learned—”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='240' id='Page_240'></span>
“Darnley the boomer!” burst out Colonel Dartwell
at this point. “So this is where you drifted
to after the swindle at Silver Run.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know him?” queried Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only too well. He was in Colorado for several
years under the name of Chester Darnley. He is a
boomer and all-around swindler.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a—a falsehood,” burst from Alexander
Slocum’s lips, but his voice trembled as he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can prove all I say,” said the colonel.
“There are witnesses enough against you at
Silver Run.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slocum was all but overcome. He sank in a
chair, and a moment later one of the detectives
came up and slipped a pair of handcuffs on his
wrists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The proprietor of the so-called sanitarium was
also arrested, and both prisoners were driven
down to the Brooklyn police station. A hearing
was had, and the prisoners were held for trial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From Brooklyn the colonel, Nellie, and Jerry
returned to New York. Nellie left the party to go
home, and Jerry and the colonel continued on to
Slocum’s office with an officer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The book-keeper, Casey, was found and arrested,
and the office was placed in care of the authorities.
The next day Jerry recovered his father’s papers
and also those belonging to Nellie Ardell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young oarsman lost no time in sending
<span class='pageno' title='241' id='Page_241'></span>
word home how matters had turned, stating that
the claim was probably worth a good deal of
money. He added that if his father was not well
enough to come to the metropolis, Colonel Dartwell
stood ready to take entire charge of the case
and see that they got their rights.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An answer soon came back, written by Mrs.
Upton. Mr. Upton was well enough to sit up, but
that was all, and he would be glad enough to do
as his son had suggested. So the necessary papers
were made out, and a suit instituted against Alexander
Slocum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime, Mr. Islen sold out his bindery,
and by this turn of affairs our hero found himself
out of employment. But he had had enough of
the great metropolis for the present, and was glad
enough to go back to Lakeview while awaiting the
time when Slocum should be brought to trial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The news of what he had accomplished had
leaked out, and when he arrived he found Harry
and Blumpo awaiting him at the depot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a clever one, Jerry!” cried Harry,
shaking his hand warmly. “To run off on the
quiet and come back with a fortune for your
family.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We haven’t got the fortune yet,” laughed
the young oarsman. “But we hope to have it
before long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I always said Jerry was de greatest boy dat
<span class='pageno' title='242' id='Page_242'></span>
eber was born,” ejaculated Blumpo, with his face
on a broad grin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is your father Blumpo?” asked Jerry,
to change the subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s very well again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must tell us your whole story,” went on
Harry. “I am dying to hear it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will—but I must get home first,” answered
the young oarsman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was soon on his way to the farm, where his
parents received him with open arms. A splendid
dinner was awaiting him—such a repast as he had
not had since leaving—but none of the food was
touched until his tale was told from end to end,
with all of its details as they have been presented
to my readers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You did well, son,” was Mr. Upton’s comment.
“I don’t believe anybody could have done better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Upton smiled fondly and put her arms
about the boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s our Jerry, father,” was all she said, but
the simple words meant a good deal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His own story told, and the dinner finished,
Jerry wanted to know the news around Lakeview,
but his parents had little to tell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have not been out since your father was
taken down,” said Mrs. Upton. “You’ll have
to ask Harry Parker and your other friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='243' id='Page_243'></span>
“Have Si Peters and Wash Crosby been caught
yet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, and I doubt if they ever do catch them,”
responded Mrs. Upton.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>HARRY TO THE RESCUE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Early on the following morning Harry came
over to take Jerry for a sail on the lake in the
Whistler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can sail and talk at the same time,” he explained.
“I know you must be longing for a whiff
of the water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are right there, Harry,” returned the
young oarsman. “Lake Otasco is better than the
hot pavements of New York City a hundred times
over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two boys soon set off. Harry had expected
Blumpo to accompany them, but that youth was
out in his own boat with a party that had hired
the craft for several days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blumpo is making money,” said Harry, “and
I am glad of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So am I,” replied our hero. “He is an odd
sort of chap, but his heart is of gold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Whistler was soon on her way up the lake
with old Jack Broxton at the tiller, and as the
breeze was steady the boys had little to do but
<span class='pageno' title='245' id='Page_245'></span>
talk. Once again our hero related his story, and
Harry proved a most attentive listener.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That Alexander Slocum ought to go to prison
for life,” he said, at the conclusion. “The idea
of daring to make out that Nellie Ardell was
insane.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a bold scheme, Harry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems to me the world is full of bad people,
Jerry. Look at such men as that Slocum and his
tools, and then at such boys as Si Peters and
Wash Crosby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where do you suppose Crosby and Peters
are?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The authorities don’t know. But Blumpo
told me a few days ago he was almost certain he
had seen them on the north shore of the lake. He
said they took to their heels in the bushes just
about the time he spotted them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are bound to be brought to justice
sooner or later.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. But I do know one thing; I
would like to get back my gold watch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus the talk ran on, until Hermit Island was
reached. Here they ran in for a few minutes, to
pass a word with Blumpo’s father, who greeted
them cordially. After this, they continued up
along the south side of the lake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they skirted the beautiful shore they gradually
crept up to a large excursion boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='246' id='Page_246'></span>
“Hullo, what’s that boat doing here?” cried
Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a Sunday school excursion from Cedar
Falls,” replied his chum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The steamboat was not a large one and she
seemed to have more than her regular allowance
of passengers aboard. Every deck was full of
grown folks and children, dressed in their best.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A band was playing a merry air, and some of
the children were singing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s give them a cheer,” suggested the young
oarsman, as they drew closer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” replied Harry, pulling out his handkerchief.
“One, two, three. Hurrah! hur—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry stopped short, as a cry of horror arose
on board of the excursion boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A young girl had been standing close to the rail
on a camp stool at the bow of the boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the steamboat swung around the girl lost her
balance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She tried to save herself, and, failing, pitched
headlong into the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry saw her go under the greenish waves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’ll be struck by the paddle wheel,” he yelled,
and then, splash! he was overboard himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bravely he struck out to save the maiden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The order was given to back the steamboat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wheels churned up the water into a white
foam, but still the momentum carried the large
<span class='pageno' title='247' id='Page_247'></span>
craft on. In the meantime Harry came up and
struck out valiantly for the girl, who was now
going down for a second time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Save her! Save her!” shrieked the mother of
the girl, in an agony of fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half a dozen life preservers were thrown overboard,
but none came to where the girl could
reach them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mother of the girl wanted to join her daughter
in the water but strong hands held her back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The young fellow will save her, madam!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a true hero!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Life lines were thrown over, but even these did
no good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The steamboat swung around, but the run of
the water washed the girl closer and closer to the
paddle wheel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She now came up a second time. Should she
sink again all would be over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry was swimming with all the strength and
skill at his command.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last he was within a yard of the struggling
girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The maiden threw up her hands and went under.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As quick as a flash Harry dove down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A second passed. Then up came the youth with
the girl clinging to his shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now the current was apparently too strong
for both of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='248' id='Page_248'></span>
They were hurled up against the paddle wheel of
the steamboat, and then disappeared entirely
from view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack Broxton gave a groan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Harry is lost!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry shuddered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It looks like it,” he replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The captain of the steamboat did not dare to
move his craft for fear he would do more harm
than good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mother of the girl continued to struggle to
free herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now a cry was heard. It came from the
stern of the steamboat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There they are!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The girl is safe and so is that brave young
man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry and Jack Broxton heard the cry, and
immediately put about in their yacht.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry was swimming along on his side. The
girl was too weak to support herself, and he was
holding her up well out of the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It took the Whistler but a moment to run up
alongside of the pair. Jerry reached over and
caught hold of the girl and placed her on deck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime Harry secured a rope thrown
by Jack Broxton and pulled himself up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A cheer arose from those on the excursion boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is safe now, sure!”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='249' id='Page_249'></span>
The girl was too exhausted to move, and both
boys rubbed her hands and did what they could
for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack Broxton ran up alongside of the steamboat
and a little later the girl was placed on
board.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mother clasped her child to her breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go ahead, Jack,” said Harry in a low voice.
“I don’t want the crowd to stare at me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the mother wants to thank you,” began
Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Harry would not listen. He was too modest,
and made Jack Broxton actually run away
from the excursion boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But five hundred people cheered Harry and
waved their handkerchiefs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did you escape the steamboat?” asked
Jerry, when the excitement was over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We went under part of her,” was the reply. “I
swam for all I knew how, but it was a close call.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this Harry retired to the cabin and
changed his clothing. He drank several cups of
hot coffee, and half an hour later declared that
he felt as well as ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The remainder of the run down the lake was uneventful.
They dropped anchor near the mouth of
the Poplar River and started in to fish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had all the necessary tackle on board, and
procured bait at a boathouse near by.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='250' id='Page_250'></span>
The yacht was anchored at a well-known spot,
and then the sport began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve a bite!” cried Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And sure enough he had something. He began
to reel in with great rapidity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“First fish,” said Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scarcely had Harry landed his haul than click,
click, click went Jerry’s reel. The line went off like
a flash.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry began to reel in. That something big was
on his hook was certain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fish darted in every direction and Jerry had
his hands full playing him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll lose him!” cried Harry, excitedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll do my best with him,” responded Jerry,
quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After playing the fish for nearly five minutes he
reeled him in rapidly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get the landing net, Jack,” he said, and the old
tar stood ready the moment the fish came into
view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A bass! A three-pounder!” cried Harry. “By
jinks! but that’s a haul worth making!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was indeed a beautiful catch, and Jerry was
justly proud of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this nothing was caught for twenty minutes.
Then Harry landed a fine fat perch weighing
a pound. Jack was not fishing, but smoked
and looked on contentedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='251' id='Page_251'></span>
Evening found them with a fine mess of bass and
perch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bad haul,” said Jerry, as he surveyed
the lot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon it’s about time to be gitting back,”
observed Jack Broxton. “We want ter make
Lakeview afore dark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the anchor was hoisted and away they went
before a nine-knot breeze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The return was made along the north shore.
Here there were numerous little islands, separated
from the mainland by a series of channels, some
shallow and others deep enough to admit of the
passage of a good-sized yacht.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Whistler was just passing one of these channels,
and Jerry and Harry were at the side, cleaning
their fish, when suddenly old Jack Broxton
uttered a cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, Jack?” asked the young oarsman,
quickly, while Harry also raised up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a boat over yonder, back of that
island, and I’m certain I saw Si Peters and Wash
Crosby on board,” was the old boatman’s interesting
answer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XL.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>A STRUGGLE IN THE DARK.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“You are sure?” demanded Jerry and Harry,
in a breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. The boat had the name Redeye painted
on the stern. If I remember rightly, she belongs
to a tough crowd of fishermen from Long Lake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is she now?” demanded Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Back there, somewhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must follow that boat; eh, Jerry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am willing,” replied the young oarsman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may have lively times with that crowd,”
put in Jack Broxton with a grave shake of his
head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll risk it,” answered Harry. He was thinking
of his missing gold watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The course of the Whistler was changed, and
soon they rounded the shore of the island Jack
Broxton had pointed out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sure enough, there was the Redeye, with all sails
set, making up the lake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near the stern stood Si Peters, Wash Crosby
and several rascally looking men.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='253' id='Page_253'></span>
“They have discovered that we are after them,”
cried Jerry, a few minutes later. “See, they are
crowding on all sail!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young oarsman was right. Leaving the
vicinity of the islands, the other craft stood
out boldly into the lake, and cut the water like
a knife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s a good one,” observed Jack Broxton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Whistler already had all sails out; and
thus the craft went on, neither gaining nor losing
for half an hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then darkness settled over the lake, and the
wind fell flat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve lost them now,” said Harry, dismally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a good thing the wind has fallen,” replied
Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As soon as it is dark enough we can take the
row-boat and follow in that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s an idea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon night had settled over Lake Otasco. Then
our hero and Harry lost no time in entering the
tender of the Whistler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Make as little noise as possible,” cautioned
Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was in the bow peering ahead, while Harry
was at the oars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they went on a distance of a quarter of a
mile.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='254' id='Page_254'></span>
“See anything?” whispered Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not yet. Pull in a little closer to shore. I
have an idea Peters and Crosby may land somewhere
around here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like as not that is their game.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On they went, the darkness growing more intense
as they proceeded. There was no moon,
and the stars shone but faintly in the blue vault
overhead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly Jerry held up his hand as a sign to
Harry to stop rowing. Instantly his chum raised
the oars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you see?” he whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something ahead—I can’t make out just what
yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several minutes of breathless silence followed.
Then Jerry bent back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Redeye is just ahead, but I believe Si
Peters and Wash Crosby have already left her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A second later a low but clear cry rang out:
“You left that bundle behind, Crosby!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind, I don’t want the old suit,” was the
reply, coming from some distance in toward shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That settles it,” whispered Jerry. “Crosby
and Peters are in a row-boat pulling for shore,
beyond a doubt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right,” replied Harry. “I would
rather tackle them than all those on the Redeye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So would I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='255' id='Page_255'></span>
The row-boat was headed for the west.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How far off the shore was they did not know.
They had located the voice of Crosby and now
steered in the direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry at the bow continued to keep his ears on
the alert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little to the right, now,” he said. “That’s
it. If you don’t make too much noise we’ll surprise
them completely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think the best thing we can do is to follow
them after they land, until they reach some place
where we can have them locked up, Jerry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is certainly a good plan. It will save us
the trouble of dragging them off to jail, if we are
fortunate enough to capture them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry’s plan was accepted, and on they went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look!” cried Jerry, presently, and pointed
down the shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see anything, Jerry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you see the lights coming toward us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry strained his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see them now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a steamer coming this way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My gracious, we’ll have to get out of the way
or we’ll be run down!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is close in shore,” went on Jerry. “I believe
she’ll pass between the other row-boat and ours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us hold up a minute and see what she intends
to do,” said Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='256' id='Page_256'></span>
He rested on his oars. Soon the craft came
closer. It was the excursion boat on her return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is not coming near us,” said Jerry. “Pull
on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry had just taken to the oars again, when a
wild cry rang out. It came from the row-boat
which held Peters and Crosby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop! Don’t run us down!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The steamboat is onto them!” ejaculated
Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scarcely had he spoken when there came another
cry, followed by a crash.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve been struck!” yelled Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pull ahead!” cried Jerry. “Like as not they
have either been killed or are drowning!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sprang to Harry’s side, and with an oar each
they sped on to the assistance of the unfortunate
ones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meanwhile the steamboat stopped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the trouble?” called a voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No answer was vouchsafed, and a moment later
the steamboat went on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like as not, Si Peters and Wash Crosby are
dead,” observed Harry, as he bent to his oar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll soon know the truth,” replied the young
oarsman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both boys pulled a swift stroke, and were soon
on the spot where the catastrophe had occurred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meanwhile the steamboat was fast disappearing
<span class='pageno' title='257' id='Page_257'></span>
in the distance. Soon the last light faded
from sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the darkness of the night Jerry and Harry
could see but little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is an oar,” cried Harry, pointing it out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And there is part of the row-boat’s bottom,”
said Jerry. “It looks as if the row-boat was actually
ground to pieces.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it isn’t likely that Si Peters and Wash
Crosby escaped.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we’ll take a good look around.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two continued to row about, but for a long
while saw nothing but bits of wreckage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then our hero beheld a form floating just to
their right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take both oars, Harry,” he said, “and be careful,
for that is Wash Crosby’s body.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry took the oars and began to row slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he moved on, Jerry stood in the bow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that instant a strange thing happened. Si
Peters came up under the boat, giving it such a
shove that Jerry was hurled overboard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, with a swiftness that was really surprising,
Si Peters clambered into the row-boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his hand he held part of a broken oar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jump out after Jerry Upton!” he growled as
he advanced upon Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without replying, Harry leaped up to defend
himself. As he did this he saw that Jerry and
Wash Crosby were fighting in the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='258' id='Page_258'></span>
Neither Crosby nor Peters had been hurt by the
collision, both having left their craft before the
steamboat struck it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their one thought now was to get the good row-boat
away from our two heroes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry, thinking Wash Crosby seriously hurt,
was taken completely by surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Crosby caught him by the shoulder and forced
him far under the water, and then did his best to
hold him there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Crosby was a powerful fellow, and he well understood
what defeat and capture meant—a term in
prison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, as we know, Jerry’s muscles were like iron,
and his first surprise over, he went for Crosby
tooth and nail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a powerful twist he freed himself from the
rascal’s grasp and swam some distance away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then coming up behind Crosby, the young oarsman
let out with his right fist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The blow took the Rockpoint bully behind the
ear, and Crosby let out a wild yell of pain, broken
by a gasp for air, as he went under the bosom of
the ocean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he went down, our hero gave him an extra
shove and then swam with all speed for the row-boat,
which had drifted several yards away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw Harry and Si Peters standing up in the
boat. Peters had just struck at his chum, and
Harry had partly dodged the vicious blow.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='259' id='Page_259'></span>
But the broken oar landed on Harry’s arm,
causing him to cry out from pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drop that, Si Peters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The command, coming so unexpectedly, startled
Peters. He turned, to find Jerry at the gunwale
directly behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Jerry, help!” cried Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Si Peters gave a low yell of rage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Harry sprang away, and now armed himself
with an oar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t frighten me, you fool!” shouted
Peters. “Don’t you dare to put your hand on the
boat!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as Jerry grasped the gunwale, Peters raised
his heavy foot as if to crush our hero’s fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Jerry was too quick for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He dropped off. Then whizz! something dark
flew through the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was part of the broken oar, thrown by Jerry,
and it took Si Peters in the neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whack him one, Harry, while you have the
chance!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry needed no advice on the subject. He
sprang in, and a second later a resounding crack
laid Si Peters flat on his back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was a good one,” cried Jerry, as he clambered
over the side. “Now bind him before he
comes to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t a blessed thing,” replied Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='260' id='Page_260'></span>
“Here is some cord. Tie his hands together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While Harry was doing this, Jerry began to
look around for Wash Crosby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This way! We are in trouble!” yelled Crosby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pshaw!” exclaimed Jerry. “He’ll have that
yacht down on us in another minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But for once the young oarsman was mistaken.
The men on the Redeye had no desire, after befriending
Si Peters and Wash Crosby, to fall into
the hands of the law, and instead of coming up
they allowed their craft to float off in an opposite
direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is Crosby!” shouted Jerry, a moment
later, as he beheld the youth floundering around
in the water. “And look, here comes the
Whistler.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was right. A slight breeze had sprung up
and Jack Broxton had nursed the yacht along
with all of the skill at his command.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The coming of the old sailor ended the battle, so
far as the bad boys from Rockpoint were concerned.
Both Si Peters and Wash Crosby were
hauled on board, and here they were tightly
bound, to prevent their making further trouble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was after midnight when Lakeview was
reached and the prisoners were handed over to the
local police. Then Harry and Jerry separated, to
go home and tell of their fresh adventures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following morning Si Peters and Wash
<span class='pageno' title='261' id='Page_261'></span>
Crosby were taken to Rockpoint and an examination
was held. The bad boys confessed robbing
the hotel and the larger part of the money taken
was recovered, as was also Harry’s gold watch,
which Si Peters had been bold enough to wear.
Some time later the evil-doers were tried and sent
to jail, and that was the last our heroes heard of
them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLI.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>A LAST RACE—GOOD-BYE TO THE RIVAL OARSMEN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurrah, here they come!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s going to be a dandy race, Harry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed it is, Dick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There comes Hosmer!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here comes Pinkney!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter with Villelet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s all right!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conversation took place on the bank of the
Hudson River, not far from Poughkeepsie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the day of the great intercollegiate boat
races.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The single-shell race had just been ordered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the number to compete in this race was
Jerry Upton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our hero was rich now—that is, his folks were,
which amounted to the same thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On trial it had been proven what a villain Alexander
Slocum was. All of his masquerading in the
west under the name of Darnley was exposed, as
well as his fraudulent land schemes in the east.
The real-estate manipulator was sent to prison for
<span class='pageno' title='263' id='Page_263'></span>
a term of years, and the property in California
was divided up between Jerry’s father, Nellie Ardell
and several others who held an interest in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The land was found to be within the city limits
of Sacramento, and the Upton share was computed
to be worth forty-five thousand dollars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Upton was offered forty thousand dollars
for it, but by the advice of Colonel Dartwell, who
became his intimate friend, he concluded to keep
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The investment is bringing in good interest,”
he said, “and as it was Jerry who did the work in
getting it, the lad shall have it just as it stands
when I and my wife die.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Immediately after these matters were settled up,
Jerry began to study for college, and Harry did
also, and both made the entrance examination
with ease.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry was a fine scholar and he was also one of
the best oarsmen in his class. Harry likewise
rowed a good deal, although not near as much as
formerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a perfect day and the river was, filled with
pleasure boats, loaded down to the rails with
sightseers. The banks of the stream were likewise
lined with the crowds which had poured in to see
the various college oarsmen compete for the supremacy
in aquatic sports.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the crowd on shore was our old friend Blumpo
<span class='pageno' title='264' id='Page_264'></span>
Brown. Blumpo was now in business at Lakeview,
letting out pleasure boats, of which he
owned several, and he was unusually prosperous.
Just at present he was wearing the colors of
Jerry’s college and “whooping her up” for our
hero whenever the chance presented itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the given signal the single shells took their
places at the starting point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The participants were the pick of the single-shell
men, and Jerry realized that he would have a
struggle to win.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A puff of smoke, the report of a gun, and they
were off!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A fine start!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hosmer leads!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He will lead to the finish!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pinkney is a close second!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jerry Upton is third!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My! but they are cutting the water!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two to one that Hosmer wins!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three to one that the record is broken!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Foah to one dat Jerry Upton wins dis race!”
cried Blumpo Brown, waving a big college flag
over his head. “Dat boy don’t know what it is to
lose!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hear that chap talk!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pitch him overboard to cool him off!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dat’s all right, it’s Jerry Upton’s muscle dat’s
talkin’, not me!” growled Blumpo.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='265' id='Page_265'></span>
Down the straight course came the single-shell
oarsmen, each back bending to a long and powerful
stroke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The quarter stretch was past with Hosmer
still in the lead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Behind him came Pinkney and Jerry, side by
side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then came the half stretch. The leaders still
held the same positions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Told you Hosmer would win!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jerry Upton is falling behind!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was true. Pinkney had increased his stroke
and was crawling up slowly but surely to the
leader.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pull, Jerry, pull,” yelled Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You dun got to win dat race, suah!” screamed
Blumpo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry heard them, but paid no heed. He was
rowing the race of the year—the race that would
make his college chums shout with joy or look
glum for the balance of the season.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now the three-quarter mark was past. A
quarter of a mile more and the race would be over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See! Pinkney is drawing up to Hosmer!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pinkney leads! Hosmer has dropped away
behind!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pinkney first and Jerry Upton second!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Villelet is crawling up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has passed Pinkney!”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='266' id='Page_266'></span>
And so the shouting went on. The end of the
course was in sight. How the oarsmen were pulling!
But now look at Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How like a flash his back bends! How powerful
is that broad stroke! How quick his recovery!</p>

<p class='pindent'>In vain Pinkney tried to hold his lead. Jerry
means to win and nothing can hold him back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He fairly flies past Pinkney and comes in a winner
by a length and a half. His friends go wild.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurrah for Jerry Upton!” shouts Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the cheers echo and re-echo along the water
and back to the distant hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blumpo dances a breakdown for joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told you he could do it,” he cries. “Da can’t
beat our Jerry nohow!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right, they can’t!” adds Harry. “Hurrah!
hurrah! hurrah!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry leaves his shell, and is hoisted up upon the
shoulders of his friends and marched around the
town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night he is given a big reception by his fellow
students. It is the happiest moment of his life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And here we will leave him and Harry and Blumpo,
and all of the rest, shouting as do our hero’s
many friends:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurrah for the Young Oarsman of Lakeview!”</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
